            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, you have <hi>Paul</hi>'s commemoration of that ſingular experience that he had of the favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence <note place="margin">Acts 23. 11.</note> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with him, and of his ſtrengthening of him. <hi>Notwithſtanding the Lord ſtood with me,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, here is the end for which the Lord ſtood by him, aſſiſted; ſtrengthned, and delivered him, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13. Phil. 4. 22.</note> That he might preach the Goſpel to the Nations. That he might have more time, and further opportunity, to ſpread abroad the everlaſting Goſpel among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whoſe Apoſtle he was. <hi>Rome</hi> at this time, was

            <p>Thirdly, here is the greatneſs of the danger, from which he was delivered; <hi>viz. From the mouth of the</hi>

This bloody Monſter <hi>Nero</hi> raiſed the firſt bloody Perſecution.

Sinners look to your ſelves: if you will ſin with others, you muſt expect to ſuffer with others. 3. Or if a man hath been beneficial to him. 4. Or if a man lyeth proſtrate before him, in the manner of a ſupplicant; but <hi>Daniel</hi> was not ſafe, he was not ſecured by any of theſe meanes, but God ſecured him in the midſt of theſe dreadful dangers by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of an Angel. <hi>[My God hath ſent his Angel, and hath ſhut the Lyons mouths, that they have not hurt me,</hi> Dan. 6. 22.] Others ſay, that God ſecured <hi>Daniel,</hi> by taking away the Lyons hunger from them, at that time, and by cauſing in them a ſatiety. And ſome tell us, that God ſecured him, by raiſing ſuch a phantaſy in the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they looked upon <hi>Daniel,</hi> not as a prey, but as on one, that was a friend unto them. But now in the midſt of this dreadful danger, how doth <hi>Daniel</hi>'s faith ſparkle and ſhine, Ver. 23. <hi>Then was the King exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they ſhould take Daniel up out of the den; So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his God.

Sin is never-ſo bitter, and holineſs is never ſo ſweet, as when our troubles are greateſt, and our dangers higheſt. By afflictions the Lord teaches his People to ſit looſe from this world, and to make ſure the great things of that other world.

By Gods favourable preſence a man comes to learn many leſſons in a time of adverſity, which he never learned in a day of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for we are like idle boyes and bad ſcholars, that learn beſt when the rod is over us. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was better <note place="margin">Iſa. 39. 1, 2, 3, 4. 5.</note> upon his ſick bed, than when he was ſhewing of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to the Ambaſſadours of the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was a better man, when he was in his wilderneſs <note place="margin">Pſalm 30. 6, 7.</note> condition, than when he ſet upon his Royal throne; the Jews are ever beſt, when in the worſt condition; the Athenians would never mend tell they were in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

The Lord never ſhews more of his favourable, ſignal, and eminent preſence, than by teaching of his People many gracious and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel leſſons by their great troubles, deep diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Lord doth manifeſt his favourable, his ſignal, his eminent preſence with his People, in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, by raiſing, ſtrenthening, and acting, their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering graces, <hi>viz.</hi> their faith, hope, love, patience, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, courage, boldneſs, zeal, conſtancy.

The habits of grace cannot act of themſelves, there muſt be renewed ſtrength imparted to ſet them on <note place="margin">Pſalm 119. 35.

Cant. 4. 16. <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come thou South wind, blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out.</hi> By the garden we may ſafely

Habitual grace cannot operate and dilate, and put forth it ſelf into exerciſe, till by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current preſence and aſſiſtance of Chriſt it is educed into act; no Saint can act that grace he hath received by his own ſtrength, without the preſence and aſſiſtance of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 15. 16. <hi>But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace, which was beſtowed upon me, was not in vain, but I labour more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with me.</hi> He does not ſay, the grace of God which was in me, that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace which I had: but, The grace of God which was with me. So then it is not the ſtrength of habitual grace, that will carry a man through doing or ſuffering work, but the auxiliary, the aſſiſting, the conquering grace of Jeſus Chriſt; it is his grace with us, more than his grace in us.

            <p>Sixthly, The Lord doth manifeſt his favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> his ſignal and eminent preſence with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in their greateſt troubles; deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, by encouraging, imbolding, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating and heartning up his People, in the midſt of all their troubles, diſtreſſes and dangers, and by putting new life, ſpirit, and mettle into them; when they are <note place="margin">2 Chron. 13. 12.

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command from God to charge <hi>Joſhua</hi> to be couragious, Deut. 1. 38. cap. 3. 28.

And why all this? not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Joſhua</hi> had diſcovered any faint-heartedneſs or cowardiſe, but becauſe the work he was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was ſo weighty and perillous, in regard of thoſe many and mighty Nations, whom he was to deſtroy, and plant the Iſraelites in their room: the work that <hi>Joſhua</hi> was to undertake was attended with many great difficulties and dangers, in reſpect of the Enemies he was to encounter, as being men of vaſt and Giant-like ſtatures and ſtrength, and dwelling in Cities with high walls and ſtrongly fortified. Now the main Argument to raiſe his courage and mettle, is drawn from Gods ſpecial preſence and aſſiſtance, <hi>Joſhua 1. 9. For the Lord thy God is with thee, whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou goeſt.</hi> We are not to underſtand it of Gods general preſence in all places, but of his ſpecial, favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſignal, and eminent preſence, which God would manifeſt in his preſervation and protection, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the difficulties, enterpriſes, dangers and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that he was to encounter with. So 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 7. Be ſtrong and courageous, be not afraid nor diſmayed, for the King of Aſſyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>With him is an arm of fleſh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our battels,</hi> &amp;c. At this time the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104355:19"/> come afterwards in the fleſh; but rather, that this great myſtery was here ſhew'd for the greater comfort of the faithful, that they might couragiouſly bear all their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, having the Prince and Head both of Angels and men preſent with them herein to mitigate their pains and carry them through with joy; this being a greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of grace and love, then to have the protection of a meer Angel; concerning whoſe power alſo, whether he can change the nature of fire, that it ſhall not burn, is very doubtful and queſtionable, ſeeing this argueth om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, which is in God alone, and not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any Creature.

Exod. 3. 2. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord</hi> (that is Chriſt <note place="margin">Chriſt is called the Meſſenger or Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Mal. 3. 1.</note> the Angel of the Covenant) <hi>appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midſt of a Buſh; and he looked, and behold, the Buſh burned with fire, and the Buſh was not conſumed.</hi> Verſe 3. <hi>And Moſes ſaid, I will now turn aſide, and ſee this great ſight, why the Buſh is not burnt.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Seneh</hi> which is he uſed, ſignifies a Dry-buſh, a Bramble-buſh, whence the Mount and Wilderneſs is called <hi>Sinai,</hi> of the ſtore of brambles that grew there, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104355:20"/> of this Buſh or Viſion. Now for a Buſh, a Dry-buſh, a Bramble-buſh to be all on fire and yet not conſumed, this muſt be a wonder of wonders: but all this is from the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh. Out of theſe two Verſes we may briefly obſerve theſe few things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the low, and weak, and brittle eſtate of the Church, repreſented by a Buſh, a Dry-buſh, a Bramble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh; what more brittle, weak, baſe, low, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, than a Dry-buſh, a Bramble-buſh? What is ſuch a Buſh good for but the fire, or to ſtop a gap, or ſome ſuch inferiour uſe? A Buſh is a black, deformed, and uncomely thing. Corruption and affliction, ſin and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering renders the Saints very uncomely. The Church is compared not to a ſtrong ſturdy oke, but to a we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Buſh, and Elſewhere to a Vine, a Dove, a Lamb, a Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all frail weak Creatures. It is good for all Saints to have low and mean thoughts of themſelves for here they are reſembled to a Dry-buſh, a Bramble-buſh. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, a Dry-buſh, a Bramble-buſh pricks, wounds and vexes them that handle it roughly. This Buſh is in Hebrew called <hi>Seneb,</hi> (as I have hinted before) which the Hebrews deſcribe to be a ſhrub full of pricks, and without fruit, and ſo thick that a bird cannot enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ruffling and pulling off her feathers. Let the proud enemies of the Church look to themſelves, for this Bramble-buſh will vex, prick, wound, tear, and put them to the worſt, when they have done their worſt. In all the Ages of the World this Bramble-buſh, the Church, hath been a cup of trembling unto all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Zach. 12 2, 3.</note> round about, and a burdenſome ſtone; ſo that all that burden themſelves with it, ſhall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the Earth be gathered together againſt it. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider the cruelties of the Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is ſignified and repreſented by a fire; The Buſh burns with fire: In this reſemblance is ſhadowed out the oppreſſed, afflicted and perſecuted eſtate of the Iſraelites
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104355:20"/> in the Egyptian Furnace; and by fire here is meant the moſt painful terrifying and tormenting afflictions and miſeries that ſhould attend them. Great afflictions and perſecutions are in Scripture commonly ſet out by fire, as the fiery tryal, the fire of affliction. Fire is very painful, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12. Lam. 2. 3, 4. Hab. 2. 13.</note> and tormenting (in which reſpects Hell-torments are compared to fire,) ſo are great afflictions, miſeries, and ſufferings; they are very painful and tormenting; they put perſons into ſore pain and travel. Next to the pangs of Conſcience, and the pains of Hell, there are none to theſe pains and pangs that are bred and fed by ſore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by terrible tryals. It has been the lot and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods deareſt Children, to be exerciſed with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and griveous afflictions, and that in order to the diſcovery of ſin, to the imbittering of ſin, to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſin, and to the purging away of ſin, and in order to the tryal of grace, the diſcovery of grace, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace, and the increaſe of grace; and in order to the weaning of them from this World, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating their conformity to Chriſt, the Captain of their <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> ſalvation, who was made perfect through ſufferings; &amp; to ripen them for Heaven, and to work in them more, bowels of pity &amp; compaſſion to thoſe that are in miſery &amp; that ſigh &amp; groan under their Egyptian task maſters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſider the eminence of their preſervation, <note place="margin">This fire was a ſuper natural fire for, 1. It conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without fuell to ſeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. It kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low &amp; aſcended not. 3. It burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not. All which ſhews it to be a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural work.</note> though in the fire yet unconſumed. The Church of God was hot, yea all in flames, and yet not conſumed. Let the fire be never ſo hot, ſo fierce, ſo furious, ſo ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Church ſhall have a being, and live and bear up in the midſt of the flames. If the Church like the Sea looſe in one place it gits ground in another; when the worſt of men, and Devils, and Informers have done their worſt, the Lord will have a name among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on Earth. The Church with the Lamp in the ſtory laughes at all thoſe winds, that would blow it out. Well may we ſtand amazed and wonder, that ſo flaming and terrible a fire, falling upon ſo contemptible a Buſh, and ſo dry and deſpicable a ſhrub, ſhould not preſently turn
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104355:21"/> it into aſhes, for why is the fire too weak? O no. Is the Buſh ſo ſtrong, as to defend and ſecure it ſelf againſt devouring flames? O no. Or is the Buſh not apt to burn and conſume by ſo fier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a fire? O no. It is not from the impotency of the fire, nor from the ſtrength or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Buſh; for a dry Bramble-buſh in the matter of it is as combuſtible as any chaff, and as eaſily deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as any ſtubble; but becauſe the natural force thereof was r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtrained by the glorious power of God: for if God concur not with the nature of things, they cannot work nor ſhew their kind. There are two inſeparable qualities of fire: 1. To give light. 2. To burn; And yet Divine power divides and ſeparates theſe two: for this fire gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth light, but burneth not. O what a mighty, what an aſtoniſhing preſervation is here! The afflictions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Church are not a conſuming fire, but a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, as the fire in a Furnace conſumes the droſs, but tryes the gold, and puts a new luſtre, beauty, and glory upon it. <hi>Heſiod</hi> ſpeaks of thirty thouſand Demy-Gods, <note place="margin">Pſalm 121. 4, Iſa. 27. 3. Mal. 3. 17. Zach. 2. 8. Pſalm 31. 20.</note> that were keepers of men; but what are ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Gods, to that one God that neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps, but day and night keeps his People as his Jewels, as the apple of his eye, that keeps them in his Pavilion as a Prince his Favorite. There is a Dialogue between a Heathen and a Jew; after the Jews return from captivity (all Nations round about them being enemies unto them) the Heathen asked the Jew, how he and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men could hope for any ſafety, becauſe (ſaith he) every one of you is as a ſilly ſheep compaſſed about with fifty wolves. I but, ſaith the Jew, we are kept by ſuch a ſhepherd, as can kill all theſe wolves when he pleaſes, and by that means preſerve his ſheep. But,</p>

A gracious Meſſenger of the Lord in the midſt of all oppoſitions (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid of <hi>Peter)</hi> is a man made all of fire walking in ſtuble, he overcomes and conſumes all oppoſition; all difficulties are but whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to his fortitude.

            <p>A gracious ſpirit is raiſed by oppoſition; the more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it meetes with in a way of duty, the more reſolute he is for it: So far is he from being afraid of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of men, of the frowns of men, or of loſing this mans favour, or of incurring ſuch a mans diſpleaſure, that his ſpirit riſeth far more for it. It is with ſuch a man as it is with the fire in Winter, the fire burns the hotter, becauſe of the coldneſs of the air; So it is with all the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Lord, who are inflamed in the way of their duty. Come to <hi>David,</hi> and tell him, O there is a <hi>Goliah,</hi> and he is come out with a ſpear like a weavers beam, and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 4. to the 11. compared with Ver. 26, 27.</note> there is one that bears his target goes before him; where is he? ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I will fight with him, ſaith he. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers do but whet and raiſe his ſpirit, he is not afraid of any uncircumciſed Philiſtin. Ah, my Friends, this is a true noble ſpirit! Holy greatneſs of mind lies in this, when a mans ſpirit is born up upon the greatneſs of his God, and the goodneſs of his cauſe; and if that will not bear me out, ſaith ſuch a ſoul, let me ſink in it. I am content to periſh. That's a good word, more worth than a world in a faithful Miniſters eye, Ezek. 3. 8. <hi>Behold, I have made thy face ſtrong againſt their faces, and thy forhead ſtrong againſt their forheads.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>As an Adamant, harder than a flint, have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be diſmayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious houſe.</hi> The Adamant is the hardeſt of ſtones, it is <hi>Lapis ſervabilis,</hi> becauſe it keeps it ſelf by its hardneſs from all injuries, no weather, no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of hammer, or fire will break it, or conquer it. God engages himſelf to give the Prophet ſuch undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted boldneſs, and invincible courage and conſtancy, as neither ſhame nor fear ſhould prevail againſt. Divine preſence, Divine aſſiſtance does alwayes accompany a Divine call; ſuch whom God ſends he ſeconds, ſuch whom he calls, he encourages, againſt all difficulties and

As there be two kind of antidotes againſt poyſon, <hi>viz.</hi> hot and cold, ſo there are two kind of antidotes againſt all the troubles of this life, <hi>viz.</hi> fervent Prayer and holy Patience; the one hot, the otehr cold; the one quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other quickning. When a Chriſtian under great troubles, deep diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, prayes more for the ſanctification of affliction, than the removal of affliction; when he prayes more to get off his ſins, than to get off his chains; when he prayes more to get good by the rod, than to get free from the rod; when he prayes more that his afflictions may be a refining fire, than a conſuming fire, and that his heart may be low, and his graces high, and that all his troubles may wean him more from this World, and ripen him the more for the glory of that upper World: It is a great demonſtration of the ſignal preſence of God with him in all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and deep diſtreſſes. But,</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, the Lord doth manifeſt his favourable, ſignal, and eminent preſence with his People, in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, by drawing the hearts of his People nearer and cloſer to himſelf, by all the afflictions, troubles, diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and dangers, that do attend them in this World. <hi>Pſalm 119. 67.

In the dayes of that bloody perſecutour <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> the Chriſtians ſhewed as glorious power in the faith of Martyrdom, as in the faith of Miracles. The valour of the patients, and the ſavagneſs of the perſecutors, ſtriving together, till both exceeding nature and belief, bred wonder and aſtoniſhment in beholders and readers. It was a good ſaying of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſpeaking of the Saints

There is nothing more clear in Scripture and in Hiſtory than this, that the ſignal preſence of the Lord with his People, in all their great troubles, deep diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, hath made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible and unconquerable. But now others that have been deſtitute of this favourable, ſignal, and eminent preſence of the Lord, in times of great troubles, deep diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, how have they fled when none have purſued them! how faint-hearted, how greatly daunted, and how ſadly diſcouraged have they been! how have they turn'd their backs, and quitted the field, and run from their colours, without ſtriking one ſtroke. Many in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, were overcome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the encounter, for they revolted to Idolatry, before any perſecution once aſſailed them. In the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> when there was a warm perſecution, ſcarce one Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of twenty ſtood out, but fell to Popery, as faſt as leaves fall from the trees in Autumn. And ſo in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution under <hi>Decius,</hi> many Profeſſors that were rich and great in the World, they ſoon ſhrunk from Chriſt, and turn'd their backs upon his wayes. It is Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, ſignal, and eminent preſence with his People, that makes them ſtand to it in an evil day. Rom. 8. 31. <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> That is, none; but this is a more forcible denying, <hi>Who can?</hi> Doeſt thou <hi>Paul</hi> ask, <hi>Who can?</hi> I'll tell thee: The Devil can, and Tyrants can, and Informers can, and Perſecutors can,

In the 35. Verſe is a poſition, that no croſſes nor creatures can deprive us of the love of God, which is ſet down in a double interrogation, that he might add the more force and life to it, and raviſh the Readers: <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us?</hi> That is none can: But he ſpeaks with contempt; <hi>Who ſhall? ſhall tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I ſcorn it; As <hi>Goliah</hi> defied <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Doeſt thou come to me with a ſtaff?</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> with a better Spirit defies all croſſes, ſufferings, trials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as things not able to deprive ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of Chriſts love; <hi>ſhall tribulation,</hi> &amp;c. He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of Perſons, now here he ſpeaks of things, becauſe Satan and his ſworn Slaves think by ſuch things to ſeparate between God and his People. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> obſerves <hi>Paul</hi>'s wiſdome in three things: 1. That he ſaith not, Shall the love of riches, pleaſures, honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have a mighty force in them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch us; but <hi>ſhall tribulation, diſtreſs,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That he begins with the lighter, and ſo riſeth to greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, placing them in this order not caſually, but, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular art. 3. That though theſe which he here rehcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, conſiſt of a certain number, yet every one as a General hath ſpecial Troops under it: As when he ſaith Tribulation, he ſaith, imſpriſonments, bonds, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, baniſhments, &amp;c. <hi>Shall tribulation, diſtreſs, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution?</hi> &amp;c.

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104355:34"/> things. Shall famine? He which feeds on Chriſt, ſhall never periſh for hunger. Shall nakedneſs?

Shall peril? I know the hardeſt. Shall the ſword? Chriſt is to me in life and death advantage. But,</p>

I have told you of Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> who found no comfort in the time of his impriſonment, but when he was going to the ſtake, he cried out to his Friend, <hi>He is come, he is come,</hi> meaning the Comforter. <hi>Hab. 3. 17. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls.</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> In theſe words you have theſe two parts: 1. A ſad ſuppoſition. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom,</hi> &amp;c. 2. A noble and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſolution, <hi>yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> Let me firſt hint a little at the ſad ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, though there ſhould be a famin in that Land, that of all Lands was the moſt plentiful &amp; fruitful Land, yet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> would rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his ſalvation. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> of all Lands was the fruitfulleſt; 'twas as the garden of God; 'twas a Land that flowed with milk and honey, a Land of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, the beſt of all Lands, as <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes it; A Land that brought forth to <hi>Iſaac</hi> no leſs than a hundred fold; It was ſo rich a Land, that it was the granary of other <note place="margin">Dent. 8. 7, 8, 9. cap. 32. 13, 14, Gen 26. 12. 1 King. 5. 11. Acts 12. 20.</note> neighbouring Cities, and Countries, it had not only plenty for it ſelf, but bounty for others. Yet now when God ſhall turn a Paradiſe into a Wilderneſs, <hi>Habakkuk</hi> will rejoyce in the Lord, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oy in the God of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly; when the anger and wrath of God ſhall cauſe a dearth in thoſe fruits, that naturally are moſt yielding and pleaſant, yet then <hi>Habakkuk</hi> would rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his ſalvation. The fig-tree of all trees is moſt fruitful, bringing forth of its
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104355:42"/> own accord with the leaſt care and culture, fructifying in the moſt barren and ſtony places, bearing twice a year, ſooneſt ripening, and rarely failing; So the vine, thats a fruitful plant, 'tis made the emblem of plenty and fruitfulneſs. Now when there ſhall be a dearth upon theſe pleaſant fruits, yet then <hi>Habakkuk</hi> will rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his ſalvation. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, another print of Divine diſpleaſure in the ſcarcity threatned is, that it is a national famine, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral famine, an overſpreading famine, uſually if one part of the Land ſuffers ſcarcity, other parts abound with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but when God calls for a famine, he turns a whole Land into a deſart, into a barren wilderneſs: <hi>Baſhan</hi> languiſheth, and <hi>Carmel,</hi> and the flower of <hi>Lebanon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 33. 34. Nahum. 1. 4.</note> languiſheth; theſe were the richeſt ſoyl of all the Country, yet theſe were parched up, and fruitleſs by his diſpleaſure, and yet for all this <hi>Habakkuk</hi> will rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, another print of Divine diſpleaſure is this, that the Lord makes it an univerſal ſcarcity-upon all kind of foods, and ſupports of life; here is the ſtaff of bread broken, and the herds and flocks fail, and the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wine preſs, the ſeed and the vine, and the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree and the olive-tree, all become fruitleſs; ſuch a deſolation is more than ordinary, uſually when one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity fails, another abounds; if corn be dear, cattel will be cheap, that weather oft times, that hinders one kind of grain, helps another: but here God blaſts all the helps of the nature. Therefore God compares his judgments to a fire that burns all before it. The Land is <note place="margin">Joel 2. 3.</note> as the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> before it and behind it a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wilderneſs, and this the Lord points at as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Joel 1. 2. Hear this ye old men</hi> (who can talk of dear years) <hi>hath this been in your dayes, or even in the dayes of your Fathers? that which the Palmer-worm hath left, hath the catter pillars eaten.</hi> When God begins in a way of judgment, he makes an end, he makes the decayes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104355:42"/> exceſſive and violent; and yet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> will rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his ſalvation. In his reſolution you have the firſt particle <hi>(although) Verſe</hi> 17. Now this particle is an act of forecaſt, theſe miſcries may befal us; And in the 18. <hi>Verſe</hi> you have the particle <hi>(yet)</hi> &amp; that's an act of preparation againſt theſe miſeries. That particle <hi>(although)</hi> forecaſts the miſery and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>(yet)</hi> forelayes the remedy; he foreſees ſorrows in the firſt, and he provides againſt them in the ſecond, <hi>yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and joyin the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> comes with a <hi>Benedictus</hi> in his mouth (and <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is word for word <hi>Let God be well ſpoken off.</hi> God bleſſeth us really, ſignally, greatly; and we bleſs him verbally, mental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, practically.</note> ſurely it was in his heart before it was in his mouth) 2 Cor. 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.</hi> Verſe 4. <hi>Who comforteth us in all our tribulations, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi> Verſe 5. <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle begins here with thankſgiving, according to his accuſtomed man ner in all his Epiſtles; but contrary to his cuſtom doth he apply this thankſgiving wholly to himſelf. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was (ſaith <hi>Beza)</hi> becauſe the Corinthians did begin to deſpiſe him for his afflictions. (It being the common courſe of the world to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſpiſe the People of God when they are under ſufferings) Therefore he anſwered confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently for himſelf, that though he had been much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, yet he had been much comforted, and rejoyced the more in his comforts, becauſe God had comforted him for that very cauſe, that he might be able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to comfort others. God is the God of all ſorts and degrees of comfort, who hath all comforts at his diſpoſe. This phraſe, <hi>The God of all comforts,</hi> intimates to us, 1. That no comfort can be found any where elſe, he hath the ſole gift of comfort. 2. Not only ſome, but all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; no imaginable comfort is wanting in him, nor to be found out of him: Look as the air lights not without the Sun, and as fuel heats not without fire, ſo neither can any thing ſoundly comfort us without God. 3. All
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104355:43"/> degrees of comfort are to be found in him in our greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers. The lower the ebbe, the higher the tide; the deeper the diſtreſs, the greater the comforts; though the Apoſtle was greatly afflicted, yet his comforts did exceed his afflictions. 2 Cor. 7. 6. <hi>Nevertheleſs God that comforteth thoſe that are caſt down, comforted us by the coming of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">This is a moſt ſweet attribute of God a breaſt that we ſhould be ſtill ſucking at.</note> When the Corinthians were in a very low condition, when they were even ſpent with grief, and ſwallowed up in ſorrows, when they were deſtitute of all relief and comfort, then the God of all comforts did comfort them. No tribulations, no perſecutions, no grievances, no priſon doores. no boults, no bars can keep out the conſolations of God, from flowing in upon his People. God loves to comfort his People, when all their outward comforts fail them. Gods comforts are not only ſweet, but ſeaſonable; he never comes too ſoon, nor never ſtays too long. If one drop of the joy of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould fall into Hell, it would ſwallow up all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The joy of the Holy Ghoſt will certainly ſwallow up all the troubles and ſufferings that we meet with in a way of righteouſneſs. None have <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12, 13, 14.</note> been more Divinely cheerful and merry than the Saints have been under their greateſt ſufferings. <hi>John Noyes</hi> took up a faggot at the fire, and kiſſed it, ſaying, Bleſſed be the time, that ever I was born to come to this prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When they faſtned <hi>Alice Driver</hi> to the ſtake to be burnt, never did neck-kerchief (ſaid ſhe with a cheerful countenance) become me ſo well as this chain. Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> put off his cap and thanked God, when the Keepers wife brought him word that he was to be burnt on the morrow. Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> fetcht a frisk, when he was come near the place where he was to ſuffer. <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (two Auguſtin Monks) being the firſt that were burnt in <hi>Germany;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> the firſt that was burnt in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s dayes, did all ſing in the flames. Thus you ſee, that it is not the greateſt troubles, nor the deepeſt diſtreſſes, nor the moſt deadly dangers that can hinder
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104355:43"/> the joy of the Lord, from overflowing the ſoul. But,</p>
            <p>Eleventhly <hi>[If God be with us who can be againſt us?]</hi> I anſwer, none, ſo as to deprive us of our graces, which next to Chriſt are our choiceſt jewels. 1 John 3. 9. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin.</hi> That is, doth not give himſelf over to a voluntary ſerving of ſin; he do's not make a trade of ſin; he ſins not totally, finally, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly, habitually, ſtudiouſly, reſolutely, wilfully, delightfully, deadly, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>He does not make it his work to ſin,</hi> he cannot follow his luſts, as a work-man follows his trade) <hi>For his ſeed remaineth in him,</hi> The ſeed of God, the ſeed of grace, is an abiding ſeed; grace in it ſelf is certain and unchangeable, though the feeling thereof be uncertain; grace hath an abiding excellency in it; grace hath eternity ſtamped upon it; it is durable riches; other riches make themſelves wings, and flye from us, but grace will keep us company till we get to <note place="margin">Prov, 8. 18. cap. 27. 24.</note> Heaven, our laſt ſtep in holyneſs will be into happineſs; grace is a bloſſom of eternity; it is an anointing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides, <note place="margin">1 John 2. 27. John 4. 14. cap. 7. 38.</note> that is the principle of grace infuſed into you, which was typified by the unctions, or anointings in the ceremonial Law, which was ſignified by the precious ointment, poured upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that ran down to the skirts of his garments; this principle will prove durable and laſting. Grace is a well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life; grace is a river of living water: Now this river can never be dryed up, becauſe the Spirit of God is the conſtant ſpring that feeds it, and maintains it; grace is not a ſtream or a pond that may run dry, but a well, yea a ſpringing well of inexhauſtible fulneſs, ſweetneſs, vertue, and refreſhment; grace will ſtill be ſpringing up, and flowing out in all the carriages and deportments of a Chriſtian; grace will be flowing out in all a Chriſtians duties and ſervices in his outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and employments, in his tryals and ſufferings; grace will break out at a Chriſtians eyes, ears, tongue, hands, feet; where grace is a well of water, a river of living water, there that Chriſtian will ſee for Chriſt, and hear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104355:44"/> for Chriſt, and talk for Chriſt, and do for Chriſt, and walk with Chriſt; grace is a well, a river, that will be ſpringing up to everlaſting life; grace and glory differ <hi>(non ſpecie, ſed gradu)</hi> in degree, not in kind; grace dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers very little from glory, the one is the ſeed, the other the flower; grace is glory militant, and glory is grace triumphant; grace is a beginning of glory, it may be compared to the golden chain in <hi>Homer,</hi> whoſe top was faſtned to the chair of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> grace and glory are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, and inſeparable; the Pſalmiſt joyns them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Pſalm 84. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord will give grace and glory.</hi> Grace is a living ſpring that never faileth, a ſeed that never dyeth, a jewel which never conſumeth, a Sun that never ſetteth; all other gifts of whatſoever kind, worth or excellency, are but like a cloud ſoon diſpelled, a veſſel of clay ſoon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, a ſandy foundation ſoon ſunk; grace is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than gold: gold draws the heart from God, grace draws the heart to God; gold doth but enrich the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part, the ignoble part, but grace enriches the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part, the noble part; gold periſhes, but grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres; if grace were not permanent, it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note> if grace were not durable, it could not be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable; if grace were not laſting, yea everlaſting, it could not be a Chriſtians comfort in life; his ſupport in death and his glorious crown in the great day of account; grace in it ſelf is permanent, incorruptible; it fadeth not away; it is a birth that ſhall never dye; it is a plant of renown that ſhall never wither, but grow up more and more till grace be turn'd into glory: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count one of the Ancients had rather have S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s coat <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> with his heavenly graces, then the purple of Kings with their Kingdoms: No troubles, no diſtreſſes, no dangers, can deprive us of our graces, can rob us of our ſpiritual treaſure. But,</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, <hi>[If God be with us who can be againſt us?]</hi> I anſwer none, ſo as to deprive us of our inward peace, reſt, and quiet, though it thunder and lighten, and rain and blow abroad, yet a man may be at peace,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104355:44"/> and reſt and quiet at home. A man may have much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the world, and yet reſt and quiet in his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. John 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give</hi>

               <hi>unto you, not as th World giveth, give I unto you; let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</hi> No men nor Devils, no troubles, nor diſtreſſes, can deprive a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of that inward and bleſſed peace that Chriſt hath purchaſed and paid ſo dear for. Peace with God and peace of conſcience are rare jewels, that none can ſtrip us <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> of. The world may wiſh you peace, but it is only Chriſt can give you peace. The worlds peace is commonly a dear bought peace, but Chriſt's peace is a cheap peace, a free peace. <hi>[My peace I give unto you.]</hi> The worlds peace is commonly a ſinful peace, but Chriſt's peace is a holy peace; the worlds peace is a curſed peace, but Chriſt's peace is a bleſſed peace; the worlds peace is but an earthly peace, but Chriſt's peace is an heavenly <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.

Some Chriſtians thought that others could not come to Heaven if they did not eat ſuch meates at they, but <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, that the kingdom of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in meat or drink, but in righteouſneſs &amp; peace, &amp; joy of the Holy Ghoſt. The worlds peace is but an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary peace, but Chriſt's peace is a real peace. The worlds peace is but a ſuperficial peace, but Chriſt's peace is a ſolid and ſubſtantial peace. The worlds peace is but <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5 3. 1 Pet. 3. 11. Jam. 3. 21. Iſa 9. 6, 7.

The Worlds peace is but a temporary peace, but Chriſt's peace is an eternal peace; it is a peace that all the world can't give to a Chriſtian, and it is a peace that all the world can't take from a Chriſtian.

               </gap>ft to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and this Legacy none can take from them. Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors may take away my goods, but they cannot take away my peace; they may take away my eſtate, but they cannot take away my peace; they may take away my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but they cannot take away my peace; they may take away my good name, but they cannot take away my peace; they may take away my relations, but they cannot take away my peace; they may take away my life, but they cannot take away my peace. I grant that the beſt have no perfection of peace, becauſe they have no perfection of grace. If there were a perfection of grace, then there might be a perfection of peace, but the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of both is reſerved for another world; and it muſt be granted that though ſometimes a believer may want the ſenſe of peace, the ſweet of peace, yet the grounds of his peace are ſtill fixt, certain and conſtant; they are like mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot be remov'd. Now the grounds of a Chriſtians peace are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Intereſt in Chriſt, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, juſtification, remiſſion of ſin, adoption, the Covenant of grace &amp; peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe are always ſure and everlaſting, though the ſenſe of peace may eb &amp; flow, riſe and fall in a believers breaſt, eſpecially when he is a combating with ſtrong corruptions, or high tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, or under ſad deſertions, or when unbelief has got the throne, or when their hearts are quarrelſom, for commonly a quarrelſom heart is a troubleſom heart; or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104355:45"/> when they have blotted their evidences for Heaven, or when they are fallen from their firſt love, or when they have contracted eminent guilt upon their ſouls, or when they are declined in their communion with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in theſe caſes though a believer may loſe the ſenſe of peace, yet the grounds of his peace remain firm and ſure, and though he may loſe the ſenſe of his peace, yet in all theſe ſad and dark conditions his ſoul is day and night in the purſuit of peace, and he will never leave the chaſe till he has recovered his peace, knowing that God <note place="margin">Pſalm 85. 8. 1 John 3. 9.</note> will firſt or laſt ſpeak peace to his ſoul; yea, though he has loſt the ſenſe of peace, yet he has that abiding ſeed of grace in his ſoul, that will in time recover his peace; do your enemies threaten to take away this or that from you, you may throw up your caps at them, and bid them do their worſt, for they can never take that peace from <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6.</note> you that Chriſt has given as a Legacy to you; when there are never ſo great ſtorms within or without, yet then a believer may find peace in the Prince of peace; when his imperfections are many, a perfect Saviour can keep him in perfect peace in the midſt of them all, though his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 3, 4. Heb. 7.</note> are imperfect, yet Chriſt a perfect Prieſt can ſpeak peace to his ſoul. Peace is that never-fading garland, which Chriſt will ſo ſet and ſettle upon the heads of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that none ſhall be able to take it off. A Chriſtian can never loſe his inward peace, either totally or finally; 'tis true by Sin, Satan, and the World, a Chriſtians peace may be ſomewhat interrupted, but it can never be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt. The greateſt ſtorms in this World that beat upon a believer, will in time blow over, and the Sun of righteouſneſs, the Prince of peace, will ſhine as gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him as ever.

And
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104355:46"/> what power or policy is there, that can deprive us of this Legacy? ſurely none. The peace that Chriſt gives is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon his blood, upon his righteouſneſs, upon his ſatisfaction, upon his interceſſion, and upon a Covenant of peace, and therefore it muſt needs be a laſting peace, an abiding peace. But,</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>[If God be with us, who can be againſt us?]</hi> I anſwer none, ſo as to hinder us from being hid, ſecured, guarded, and protected by God in an evil day, or in a day of greateſt trouble, diſtreſs, or danger. <hi>Jer. 39. 11. Now Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, gave charge concerning Jeremiah, to Neburazadan the Captain of the Guard, ſaying:</hi> Verſe 12. <hi>Take him, and look well to him,</hi> [Heb. <hi>Set thine eyes upon him] and do him no harm, but do unto him, even as he ſhall ſay unto thee.</hi> Here you ſhall ſee the admirable power, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God, inclining the heart of this great Monarch &amp; Conquerour to provide for the Prophets ſafety and ſecurity, he that was a dreadful ſcourge to puniſh the wicked, is made by God the deliverer and preſerver of the Prophet. In the 12 Verſe you have the Kings Royal Commiſſion to the Captain of his Guard, to be as kind to him as tender of him, and to carry it as courteouſly to him, even as the Prophet himſelf ſhould deſire: <hi>Look well to him, do him no harm, but do unto him even as he ſhall ſay unto thee.</hi> Let him have all the content, all the ſatisfaction, and all the accommodation that himſelf ſhall require. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>The Lord ſaid, Verily I will cauſe the enemy to intreat thee well in the time of evil, and in the time of affliction.</hi> Heb. <hi>If I do not cauſe,</hi> &amp;c.

But</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>(If God be with us, who can be againſt us?)</hi> I anſwer, None, ſo as to deprive us of our union with Chriſt, as to diſſolve that bleſſed union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> Chriſt and our ſouls. When Men and Divels have done their worſt, our Mariage union with Chriſt holds good, this union is indiſſoluble; this union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt &amp; Believers is not capable of any ſeparation, they are ſo one, that all the violence of the world, nor all the power of darkneſs, can never be able to make them two again. Hence the Apoſtle's triumphant challenge, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> If the queſtion <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35.</note> did not imply a ſtrong Negation; the Apoſtle himſelf doth give us a negation in words at length, <hi>Neither death,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>nor life, nor Angels, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us,</hi> &amp;c. Here you have a long Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, conſiſting of a large induction of various parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; But none of all theſe can diſſolve the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers. None can untie that knot, that is tied by the Spirit on Chriſts part, and by Faith on ours. Chriſt and Believers are ſo firmly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that all the powers on earth, and all the united ſtrength of Hell, ſhall never be able to put them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or to ſeparate them one from another, look as no diſtance of place can hinder this union, ſo no force or violence from Devils or Men, ſhall ever be able to diſſolve this union, and herein lies the peculiar, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104355:47"/> bleſſedneſs of this union above all other unions, they all may ceaſe, be broken and come to nothing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them is ſoluble: The head may be ſeparated from the members, and the members from the head; the Husband muſt be ſeparated from the Wife, and the Wife from the Husband; the Parents muſt be ſeparated from the Children, and the Children from the Parents, and boſom friends muſt be ſeparated one from another. The foundation and the houſe may be ſeparated, and the branches may be cut off from the vine, yea the ſoul and body may be diſunited by death, but the myſtical union ſtands faſt for ever: Chriſt and a gracious ſoul can <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 6.</note> never be ſeparated, God hath joyned them together, and no mortal ſhall ever be able to put them aſunder; there is not only a continuation of it all our life, but alſo in death it ſelf: Our very bodies ſleeping in the duſt, are (even then) in union with Chriſt. There are two abiding things in the Saints, their unction, and their union; their unction abides, <hi>But the anointing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 2. 27.</note> 
               <hi>which ye have received of him abideth in you;</hi> and their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion abides, for it follows, <hi>and ye ſhall abide in him.</hi> Chriſt earneſtly prayes, that we might be one, as he <note place="margin">John 17. 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> and his Father are one; not eſſentially, nor perſonally, but ſpiritually, ſo as no other Creature is united to Chriſt. There can be no Divorce between Chriſt and <note place="margin">Malach. 2. 19.</note> the believing Soul; Chriſt hates putting away: Sin may for a time ſeemingly ſeparate between Chriſt and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but it can never finally ſeparate between Chriſt and the Believer. Look as it is impoſſible for the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is in the dough, to be ſeparated from the dough, after it is once mixed, for it turneth the nature of the dough into it ſelf; ſo it is impoſſible for the Saints ever to be ſeparated from Chriſt: for Chriſt is in the Saints as <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 10. Coloſſ. 1. 27. 1 John 3. 21. John 17. 23.</note> nearly and as really, as the leaven is in the dough. Chriſt and Believers are ſo incorporated, as if Chriſt and they were one lump: Our nature is now joyned to God by the indiſſolvible tye of the Hypoſtatical union in the ſecond Perſon; and we in our perſons are joyned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104355:48"/> to God, by the myſtical indiſſolvible bond of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the third Perſon. Our union with the Lord Jeſus, is ſo near, ſo cloſe, and ſo glorious that it makes us one ſpirit with him. In this bleſſed union the Saints are not only joyned to the graces and benefits which flow <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> from Chriſt; but to the Perſon of Chriſt, to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all the powers on Earth, and all the powers in <note place="margin">John 1. 16. Rom. 8. 32. 1 Cor. 3. 21, 22, 23.</note> Hell, can never ſeparate Chriſt from the Believer, nor the Believer from Chriſt, when all other unions are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, this union holds good.</p>
            <p>I readily grant that the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this union may (in this life) be much interrupted, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times greatly darkned, but the ſubſtance of the union ſtill remains: And I readily grant that a Believer may be much aſſaulted and tempted to doubt of his union with Chriſt, and to queſtion his union with Chriſt, and yet nevertheleſs a Believers union with Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues and abides for ever. And I readily grant that the influences of it for ſome time may be ſuſpended, but yet the union it ſelf is not, nay cannot be diſſolved. As it was in the Hypoſtatical union, for a time there was a ſuſpending of the comforting influences of the Divine nature in the humane, in ſo much that our Saviour cried out: <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Yet for all this the union between the two natures, was not <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 46.</note> in the leaſt aboliſhed; ſo here in the Myſtical union, the ſenſible effects, comforts, and benefits of our union with Chriſt, may ſometimes be kept in and not appear, but yet the union it ſelf abides, and ſhall abide firm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable for ever; 'tis an inſeparable and inſuperable u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Look as no power on earth is ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Spirit of Chriſt, which on Chriſts part makes <note place="margin">John 10. 27. 31. 1 John 4. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 5. Luke 22. 31, 32.</note> the union, ſo no power on earth ſhall be able to conquer Faith, which on our part alſo makes the union: Satan and the world may make attempts upon this union, but they will never be able to break this union, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this union; yea though death be the bane of all natural unions, yet death can never be the bane of this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104355:48"/> Myſtical union, though death puts a period to all other unions, yet death can never put a period to this union; when the Believer is in his grave his union with Chriſt holds good. But</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>(If God be with us, who can be againſt us?)</hi> I anſwer, None, ſo as to deprive us of our crowns, there is no power nor policy on Earth or in hell that can deprive a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of his crown of righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> 'Tis a Metaphor (ſay ſeveral) from the <note place="margin">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is given only to righteous men; all that wear this crown come to it in a way of righteouſneſs; a righteous Crown cannot be had but in the uſe of righteous means. The Chaldean, the Perſian, the Grecian, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princes commonly gained their Crowns by fraud, flattery, policy, blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that their Crowns were bloody Crowns, and not righteous Crowns. 5. and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Apoſtle calls it a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the righteous Judge ſhall give him; the more fitly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Metaphor taken from Runners and Wreſtlers, for prizes at their ſolemn e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

A reſervation and ſafe keeping of it, to the uſe of thoſe it is deſigned to. Earthly Crowns have been often pulled off from Princes heads, but this Crown of righteouſneſs is ſo ſafely laid up, that none can reach it, none can touch it, none can pull it from a Believers head. <hi>Xerxes</hi>

Princes Crowns are withering things; Earthly Crowns may be ſoon put on, and as ſoon be pulled off: Moſt Princes Crowns do but hang on one ſide of their heads. All the Powers on Earth, and all the Devils in Hell, can never reach this Crown of righteouſneſs, though wicked men have long reaches, yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach a Believers Crown, which is his joy and <note place="margin">Baſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, There is no power nor policy on Earth or in Hell, that can deprive a Chriſtian of his Crown of life, <hi>James 1. 12.

Beza</hi> reads it, <hi>Excellenter excellens, Exceedingly excellent.</hi> Yet none of theſe reach the height of the Apoſtle's Rhetorick, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any tranſlation able to expreſs it. Glory is ſo great a weight, that if the Saints were not upheld by the infinite power and ſtrength of God, it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould be able to bear it. To gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clous things the weight addeth to the value; as the more maſſie and weighty a Crown is, the more it is worth: The glory of Heaven is not only Eternal glory, but it is a weight of glory; yea ſuch a weight as exceeds all expreſſions, all compariſons: The honour and glory of this world is but like the cracking of thorns under a pot; it is but like a blaze, a ſhadow, a dream, a vapour; it is but like a fading flower, or the picture of a Prince drawn upon the Ice, with his purple Robes, and his glorious Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which melts away as ſoon as the Sun riſeth; the conſideration of which, made one Prince ſay of his Crown: O Crown! more noble than happy! A crown is the the choiceſt and chiefeſt of all humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: A mongſt all terrene gifts none more honourable and glorious than a Crown; this is the heigth of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane excellencies, and for the attainment of which many have made moſt ſad, deſperate and dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures; but alas! what are all earthly Crowns for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; dignity, to the Crown of life? No more than ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to ſubſtances, pebbles to pearls, or droſs to gold. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Crown of life ſignifies the greateſt honour and glory; there is nothing higher in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and in the admiration of men than a Crown, it is the higheſt appendent of Majeſty: A Crown is the <note place="margin">Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is nothing that Men eſteem of above a Crown, oradmire than a Crown, or are ambitious off than a Crown. The Crown is the top of Royalty; all
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104355:51"/> earthly Crowns have croſſes hanging upon them; all earthly Crowns are ſtuffed with thorns; which made a <note place="margin">Xerxes.</note> great Prince ſay, You look upon my Crown and my purple Robes, but did you but know how they are lined with thorns, you would not ſtoop to take them up. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is ſaid to ſwim to her Crown through a Sea of ſorrow: And ſo many of the Princes of this world have ſwum to their Crowns through a Sea of ſin, a Sea of trouble, a Sea of ſorrow, and a Sea of blood. The Crown of life is an honourable Crown, and that is the reaſon why the Heavenly glory is expreſt by a <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 21.</note> Crown; the Saints are heirs not only of Chriſts croſs, but alſo of his Crown, that is of his honour and glory: The honour and glory of all earthly Crowns are greatly darkned and obſcured by the cares and troubles, the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations &amp; dangers that are inſeparably annexed to them; but no cares, no troubles attend the Crown of life, the Crown of glory; Eternal life is a coronation day. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Crown of life ſignifies the reward of victory, a Crown is the honour of thoſe that ſtrive; Crowns were alwayes the rewards of Conquerours. <note place="margin">Gregory.</note> 
               <hi>Revel. 2. 10. Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</hi> A Crown without cares, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivals, envy, end; a Crown not of gold, ſilver, pearls, laurels, or ſuch like fading, periſhing, corruptible things, but a Crown of life, an everliving Crown, an everlaſting Crown, a neverfading Crown. 'Tis an alluſion to a cuſtom that was amongſt the Grecians, for ſuch as got the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hart</hi> p. 482</note> in their games of wraſtling, or running, or the like, were crowned with a Garland in token of victory, 'tis not he that fights, but he that conquers, that carries the Crown: The Crown of life is for that man, and that man is for the Crown of life, who holds on conquering and to conquer, as Chriſt his head has done before him. The Heathens in their Olympicks had their Cups, and Garments and Crowns that were the rewards of the Conquerors, yea if a horſe did but run a race and won, he had a Cup or a Crown; and thereupon <hi>Theocritus</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:104355:51"/> ſaith, See what poor things the world glories in, that bruit beaſts are taken with, their conquerours are crowned, and ſo are their horſes: But what were all their cups, garments, and crowns of ivy and laurel? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to this crown of life, that is promiſed to the overcoming Chriſtian; you muſt firſt be conquering Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall be crowned Chriſtians. Why do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that in one place (ſaith one of the Ancients) which <note place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> is due in another? why would you prepoſterouſly have the crown before you overcome? whil'ſt we are in our warring ſtate fighting againſt the world, the fleſh, and the Devil, a crown does not become us. I have read, how that upon a triumph all the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for the greater pompe, were to put on crowns of bays, but there was one Chriſtian among them that wore it on his arm, and being asked the reaſon of it, he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered <hi>(Non decet Chriſtianum in hac vita coronari,) It becomes not a Chriſtian to wear his crown in this life.</hi> That crown that is made out of the Tree of life, is a wreath of laurel that never withers, a crown that never fades, a crown that will ſit faſt on no head but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Crown of life ſignifies a laſting Crown, a living Crown, to ſay the Crown of life is to ſay a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Crown, and living Crowns are only to be found in <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 24. Eze. 21. 25, 26, 27.</note> Heaven. The word, Crown, notes the perpetuity of glory. A Crown is round, and hath neither beginning, nor ending, and therefore the glory of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is called an immortal, an immarceſſible, incurrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4. 1 Cor. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4.</note> and never fading Crown. The Crown of life ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the laſting honour and glory of the Saints in Heaven. I have read of an Emperour that had three crowns, one on his ſword, another on his head, and then cries out, <hi>Tertiam in Coelis, The third is in Heaven, and my hope</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See my String of Pearls.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be in the everlaſting Crown.</hi> The life to come is only the true life, the happy life, the ſafe life, the honourable life, the laſting, yea the everlaſting life, and therefore the Crown is reſerved for that life. King
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104355:52"/> 
               <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour was crowned three times every year, all his reign, at three ſeveral places, <hi>viz. Gloceſter, Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but death hath long ſince put a period to his Crown. The Crowns of the greateſt Monarchs in the world (though they laſt long) yet are <note place="margin">Hackwel.</note> corruptible, ſubject to wearing, cracking, ſtealing, they will be taken from them, or they from their crowns ſuddenly. Witneſs that pile of crowns (as the Hiſtorian ſpeaks) that was piled up (as it were) at <hi>Alexander</hi>'s gates, when he ſate down and wept, becauſe there were no more worlds to conquer. All Scripture and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do abundantly tell us, that there is nothing more fading than Princes crowns. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the Crown of life notes a well entitled crown, a crown that comes by a true and noble Title. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian has the beſt Title imaginable to the Crown of life. <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 7. 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Luk. 12. 32. 2 Cor. 11. 2. Heb. 1. 2. 2 Sam. 23. 5. Jer. 32. 40. 41.</note> 1. He has a Title by Chriſts blood. 2. By the new Birth. 3. By free and precious promiſes. 4. By donation. 5. By marriage union, and communion with Chriſt, who is heir apparent to all the glory of Heaven. 6. By a ſure &amp; everlaſting Covenant. King <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. of <hi>England,</hi> pretended a ſixfold title to the crown, 1. By conqueſt, 2. By the election of the Souldiers in the field, 3. By Parliament, 4. By birth, 5. By donation, 6. By mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but what was his pretended Title to that real and full Title, that a believer has to the Crown of life? But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, the Crown of life notes the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the glory of the Saints in Heaven; as the crown compaſſeth the head on every ſide, ſo in Heaven there is an aggregation of all internal and eternal good. One of <note place="margin">

Do you ask me what Heaven is, ſaith one, when I meet you there I will tell you. The world to come (ſay the Rabbins) is the world where all is well. I have read of one that would willingly ſwim through a Sea of brimſtone to get to Heaven, for there, and only there is perfection of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. What are the ſilks of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the ſpices of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and the treaſures of both <hi>Indies</hi> to the glory of another world? <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells us, that one day when he was about to write ſome thing upon the eighth Verſe of the thirty ſixth Pſalm, <hi>Thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy pleaſures;</hi> and being almoſt ſwallowed up with the contemplation of heavenly joyes, one call'd unto him very loud by his name; and enquiring who it was, he anſwered, I am <hi>Hierom,</hi> with whom in my life time thou hadſt ſo much conference concerning doubts in Scripture, and am now beſt experienced to reſolve thee of any doubts concerning the joyes of Heaven, but only let me firſt ask thee this queſtion: Art thou able to put the whole-Earth, and all the waters of the Sea, into a little pot? Canſt thou meaſure the waters in thy fiſt? and mete out Heaven with thy ſpan? or weigh the mountains in ſcales? and the hills in a ballance? If not, no more is it poſſible that thy underſtanding ſhould comprehend the leaſt of the joyes of Heaven; and certainly the leaſt of the joyes of Heaven are unconceivable and inexpreſſible. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is no power nor policy on Earth or in <note place="margin">Pſalm 21. 3.</note> Hell, that can deprive a Believer of an incorruptible Crown, 1 Cor. 9. 25. <hi>And every man that ſtriveth for the maſtery is temperate in all things, now, they do it to obtain</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:104355:53"/>

A man (ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom)</hi> would dwell in this contemplation of Heaven, and be loth to come out of it. Nay (ſaith <hi>Auguſtin)</hi> a man might age himſelf in it, and ſooner grow old than weary. 1 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>To an inheritance incorruptible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you.</hi> Here are ſuper-excellent properties of the Heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>

O the impure love, the carnal confidence, the vain boaſtings, the ſenfual joyes that have been the products of earthly inheritances. If a mans eſtate lyes in <note place="margin">James 5. 2, 3, 4, 5.

               <note place="margin">1 King. 9. 13.</note> gave to <hi>Hiram,</hi> which he called <hi>Cabul,</hi> that is to ſay, Diſpleaſing or Dirty. Earthly inheritances they do but durt, laub, and duſt the children of men; it is only the Heavenly inheritance that is incorruptible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>inheritance</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 An inheritance undefiled.</note> 
               <hi>undefiled.</hi> There are few earthly inheritances, but ſome defilement, or other ſticks cloſe to them; many times
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104355:53"/> they are got by fraud, oppreſſion, violence, injuſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as they are often wickedly got, ſo they are as often wickedly kept; They that will but go to <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> may every term underſtand enough of theſe things. The Heavenly inheritance is the only undefiled inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; there is no ſin, no ſinner, no Devil to defile or pollute the heavenly inheritance, the incorruptible crown. The Greek word <hi>(Amiantos)</hi> ſignifies a precious ſtone, which though it be never ſo much ſoiled, yet it cannot be blemiſhed nor defiled, yea the oftner you caſt it into the fire and take it out, the more clear, bright, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it is; The Apoſtle may probably allude to this ſtone, and it is as if he ſhould ſay, The incorruptible Crown, that you ſhall receive, ſhall be ſtudded with the ſtone <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miantos,</hi> which cannot be defiled; no unclean thing ſhall <note place="margin">Revel. 21. 27.</note> enter into Heaven to defile this Crown, this inheritance. The Serpent got into the Earthly Paradiſe, and defiled <hi>Adam</hi>'s crown, yea he robbed him of his crown, but the ſubtil Serpent can never enter into the heavenly Paradiſe. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>inheritance</hi>

How hath the Moon of great Mens honours been eclipſed at the full and the Sun of their pomp gone down at noon! How ſoon is the Courtiers glory eclipſed, if his Prince do but frown upon him, and how ſoon does the Prince
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104355:54"/> become a peaſant, if God does but frown upon him! The Greek word <hi>(Amarantos)</hi> ſay ſome, is the proper name of a flower, which is ſtill freſh and green, after it hath hung up in the houſe a long time. It is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Your incorruptible Crown ſhall be garniſhed or adorned with the precious flower <hi>(Amarantos)</hi> which is alwayes freſh, and green, and flouriſhing; And indeed this is the excellency of the Heavenly inheritance, that it fadeth not away, that it is a flower that never wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; all the glory of that upper-world is like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf laſting, yea everlaſting. This never fading Crown is like the flower we call <hi>Semper vivens,</hi> it keeps alwayes freſh and ſplendent; the glory of Believers ſhall never fade, nor wither it ſhall never grow old nor ruſty. Thrice happy are thoſe ſouls, that have a ſhare in this incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Crown. When <hi>Alexander</hi> heard the Philoſophers diſcourſe of another World, in which he had no part, he <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 13.</note> wept, to ſpeak with the Apoſtle, as <hi>one without hope.</hi> None on earth have ſuch cauſe to weep, as thoſe that have no intereſt in that inheritance that fadeth not away. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, there is no power nor policy on Earth or in Hell, that can deprive a ſincere Chriſtian of a Crown of glory. 1 Pet. 5. 4. <hi>And when the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of glory, which fadeth not away;</hi> as the garlands did, where with the conquerours at games, races, &amp; combates were crown'd, which were made of herbs, leaves, and flowers. A Crown imports perpetuity, plenty, dignity; It is the height of humane ambition. The Greek word <hi>Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinon,</hi> cometh from <hi>Amarantus,</hi> which is a flower that fadeth not, of which garlands were made in former times, and wherewith they crowned the Images of the Heathen Gods. A Believers Crown, his inheritance, his glory, his happineſs, his bleſſedneſs ſhall be as freſh and flouriſhing after he hath been many millions of years in Heaven, as it was at his firſt entrance into it. Earthly Crowns are like tennis-balls, which are bandied up and down from one to another, and in time wear out. When
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104355:54"/> time ſhall be no more, when earthly Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhall be no more, yea when the world ſhall be no more, a Chriſtians Crown of glory ſhall be freſh, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and continuing; all the Devils in hell ſhall never wrangle a Believer out of his heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor deprive him of his crown of glory. The leaſt thing in Heaven is better than the greateſt things in this World; all things on Earth are fading, but the crown of glory never fadeth away: Thus you ſee why Heaven &amp; the glory above is expreſſed by a crown; ſometimes it is called a crown of righteouſneſs, to note the grounds and riſe of it; ſometimes it is called a crown of life, becauſe it is only to be enjoyed in everlaſting life; ſometimes it is called an incorruptible crown, to note the duration &amp; continuance of it; and ſometimes it is called a crown of glory, to note the honour, ſplendour, and eternity of it. Now let Devils, let oppreſſors, let perſecutors do their worſt they ſhall never be able to deprive the Saints of their bleſſed and glorious crowns. But,</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104355:55"/> way of holyneſs, ſhall but further the increaſe and growth of their graces; grace never riſes to ſo great a height as it does in times of perſecution; Suffering times are a Chriſtians harveſt times. Let me inſtance in that grace of <note place="margin">Pſalm 69. 7, 8, 9, 12.</note> of zeal: I remember <hi>Moulin,</hi> ſpeaking of the French Proteſtants, ſaith, When Papiſts hurt us, and perſecute us for reading the Scripture, we burn with zeal to be reading of them, but now perſecution is over, our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are like old Almanacks. <hi>Michal's</hi> ſcoffing at <hi>David</hi>

Warm perſecutions will but ſet Chriſtians all on a light fire for God, as you may ſee among the Apoſtles, primitive Chriſtians, &amp; the Martyrs of a later date. Grace uſually is in the greateſt flouriſh, when the Saints are under the greateſt tryals; the ſnuffing of the candle makes it burn the brighter: God ſuffers wicked men to beat &amp; bruiſe his links, to make them burn the brighter; and to pound &amp; bruiſe his ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights, and ſo do the graces of the Saints ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights of affliction and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God does ſometimes more carry on the growth of grace by a Croſs than by an ordinance; yea the Lord will firſt or laſt turn all fiery Trials into Ordinances, for the helping of grace in his Peoples ſouls.

We know that winter is as neceſſary to bring on Harveſt as the Spring; and ſo fiery Trials are as neceſſary to bring on the Harveſt of grace as the Spring of mercy is. Though fiery Trials are grievous, yet they ſhall make the Saints more gracious: God uſually by ſmart ſufferings turns his Peoples ſparks of grace into a mighty flame, their mites into millions, their drops into Seas. All the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell and all the ſinners on earth, cannot hinder the Lord from carrying on the growth of grace in his Peoples Souls. When Men and Devils have done their worſt, God will by all ſorts of Ordinances, and by all ſorts of providences, and all ſorts of changes make his People more and more holy, and more and more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and more and more meek and lowly, and more and more heavenly, wiſe, faithful, fruitful, ſincere, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 9.</note> poor, yet ſhe was inwardly rich, rich in grace, and rich towards God.

            <p>Fourthly, The Lord will be ſignally preſent with his <note place="margin">4.

A Believer needs the preſence of God at all times, but never ſo much as in great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; deep diſtreſſes and moſt deadly dangers: For now <note place="margin">Job 2. 9.

Iſa. 41. 17, 18.</note> Satan will be ſtirring, he loves to fiſh in troubled waters; now earthly Friends, and earthly comforts, and earthly ſuccours will commonly fail us; now cares, and fears, will be multiplied upon us; now unbelief which is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually all evil, will be raiſing doubts, and cavils, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in the ſoul; ſo that if God does not ſtand by us now, what can we ſay? what can we do? how can we bear up? how can we ſtand faſt? What was <hi>Sampſon</hi> that <note place="margin">Judges 16. 19, 20.</note> man of ſtrength when his hair was gone, but as weak as water? and what is the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian when his God is gone, but as weak as weakneſs it ſelf? all our doing ſtrength, and all our ſuffering ſtrength, and all our bearing ſtrength, and all our witneſſing ſtrength lies in the ſpecial preſence of God with our ſouls; all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and all our ſupports, and all our eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all our refreſhments flow from the preſence of God with our ſouls, in our greateſt troubles and deepeſt diſtreſſes, and therefore if God ſhould leave us in a day of trouble, what would become of us, and whither ſhould we go, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104355:60"/> where ſhould we find reſt? When doth a man need a Brother or Friend, but in a day of adverſity? A Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 17.</note> is born for adverſity, though at other times Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may jar, and jangle, and quarrel, yet in a day of adverſity, in a ſtrait, in a ſtreſs, birth, and good blood, and good nature will be working.

               </gap> they could agree well enough, and then they could be mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts one to another; and when does a Chriſtian moſt need the ſtrength of God, the conſolations of God, the ſupports of God, the teachings and quicknings of God, and the ſignal ſingular preſence of God, but when they are in the greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers? When the People of God are in a low and afflicted condition, then the Lord knows that that <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 9. 10.</note> is the ſeaſon of ſeaſons for him to grace them with his gracious preſence: When calamities and dangers break in upon us, and when all heads, and hands, and hearts, and counſels are ſet againſt us; now is the time for God to help us, for God to ſuccour us, for God to ſtand by us.

            <p>Fifthly, the Lord will be ſignally preſent with his <note place="margin">5 Reaſon:</note> People in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, becauſe he dearly loves them.

Hoſ 8. 9. Mich. 7. 19. Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20.</note> God of great pity, a God of tender compaſſion, and therefore he will not leave his People in a time of diſtreſs. Parents bowels do moſt yearn towards their Children when they are ſick, and weak, and moſt in danger; it goes to the very heart of a man to leave a friend in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; but what are the bowels of men to the bowels of God! or the compaſſions of men to the compaſſions of God! There is an Ocean of love in the hearts of Parents <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 6.</note> towards their children, when they are in diſtreſs; and this love makes them ſit by their children, and ſit up with their children, and not ſtir from their children: Gods love does ſo link his heart to his People in their deep di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, <note place="margin">Pſalm 91. 15.</note> that he can't leave them, he can't ſtir from them, Iſa. 43. 4. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee.</hi> Well, and what then? This love ſo endeares &amp; unites God to his People that he can't leave them, he can't ſtir one foot from them, V. 2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the Waters I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee; when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> The Lord dearly loves his People, and he highly prizes his People, and he greatly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104355:61"/> delights in his People, and therefore he will be ſignally preſent with his People, both in the fire and in the water, both in the fire of perſecution, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the waters of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. God loves the perſons of his People, and he loves the preſence of his People, and he loves the graces of his People, and he loves the ſervices of his People, and he loves the fellowſhip of his People, and therefore he will never leave his People, but ſtand by them, and be ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent with them in their greateſt troubles &amp; deepeſt diſtreſſes. Such is Gods ſingular love to his Covenant-People, that he will neither forſake them, nor forget them in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers. The Jews were low, yea very low in <hi>Babylon,</hi> their diſtreſſes were great, and their dangers many, they looked upon themſelves as ſo many dead <note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 1. to 15.</note> men, <hi>Our bones are dry, our hope is loſt, and we are cut off for our parts;</hi> They looked upon themſelves both as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and forgotten by God.

For the bleſſed Angels, <hi>Ye are come to mount Sion, to the heavenly Jeruſalem, to an innumerable company of Angels.</hi> 3. For the congregation <note place="margin">Pſalm 87. 2.</note> of Saints, of Believers, of which it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord loves the Gates of Sion more than all the habitations of Jacob.</hi> The believing Jews being ſorely oppreſſed &amp; afflicted by a long captivity, and by many great and matchleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, that did befal them in their captive ſtate, they <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 22.

               </gap>oth engage himſelf, that he will neither forſake <hi>Sion,</hi> nor yet forget <hi>Sion</hi> in her captive ſtate. Now let us a little obſerve how this ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is amplified, and that, 1. By an emphatical illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Gods compaſſionate remembring of <hi>Sion,</hi> far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends the moſt compaſſionate remembrance of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt Mother to her dear ſucking Babe. Now this is laid down.</p>
            <p>Firſt, interrogatively, <hi>Can a Woman</hi> (the moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate ſex) <hi>forget her ſucking Child, from having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Son of her womb?</hi> Can a Woman, can a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo forget as not to compaſſionate a Child, which ſhe naturally inclines to pity? A ſucking Child that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on her breaſt, ſuch as Mothers are wont to be moſt chary of, and to be moſt tenderly affected towards? her ſucking Child, which together with the milk from the breaſt draws love from her heart? her ſucking Child of her own womb, which her bowels do more yearn over than they do over any ſucking Nurs-child in the world? and this the <hi>Son of her womb,</hi> which the Mother uſually embraceth with more warm affections, than the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her womb. Can a Woman, yea can a Mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to exerciſe love, pity, and compaſſion to ſuch a poor Babe? ſurely, very, rarely.</p>
            <p>2. Affirmatively, <hi>Yea they may forget.</hi> Its poſſible that a Woman may be ſo unwomanly, and that a Mother may be ſo unmotherly in ſome caſes, and in ſome extremities, as to forget her ſucking Child, yea as to eat the fruit of <note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 24. to 30.

            <p>Thirdly, negatively, <hi>Yet will I not forget thee.</hi> God will be more conſtantly, unmovably, and unchangeably
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104355:62"/> mindful of <hi>Sion,</hi> and tender of <hi>Sion,</hi> and compaſſionate of <hi>Sion,</hi> and watchful over <hi>Sion,</hi> than any Mother could be over her youngling, yea he would be more motherly to his poor captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> than any Mother could be to her ſucking Babe. 2. This precious promiſe is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by a convincing argumentation, and that par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God will aſſoon blot out of mind, and forget his own hands as his <hi>Sion;</hi> and partly, from his placing their walls ſtill in his fight; the ruined demoliſhed walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were ſtill before him as to their commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to their reparation, God being fully reſolved in the fitteſt ſeaſon, to raiſe and reedifie them.

Look as a man, ſtanding on the Sea ſhore ſees a great heap of waters, one wave riding upon the back of another, and making a dreadful noiſe, but all this while though he ſees the water rouling, and hears it raging and roaring, yet he ſees not the wealth, the gold, the ſilver, the jewels, and incredible treaſures that lye buried there: ſo wicked men they ſee the wants of the Saints, but not their wealth; they ſee their poverty, but not their riches; their miſeries, but not their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; their conflicts, but not their comforts; their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, but not their joyes. O this blind World cannot ſee the joyes, the comforts, the conſolations, that the Divine preſence raiſes in the ſouls of the Saints, when they are at worſt! Holy joy and cheerfulneſs under great troubles and deep diſtreſſes, is an honour to God, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſt, and a credit to Religion; it ſtops the mouths of ſinners, and it encourages and ſtrengthens weak Saints, and therefore the: Lord will be ſignally preſent with his

Certainly we
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104355:68"/> muſt frame a new Bible ere we can find any colour out of Gods afflicting us to prove that he doth not love us, or that he hath withdrawn his preſence from us. Chriſt had never more of the real preſence of his Father, than when he had leaſt of his ſenſible preſence, of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable preſence: <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 46.</note> 
               <hi>me?</hi> Here is firſt a compellation or invocaton of God twice repeated: <hi>My God, my God.</hi> Secondly, the complaint it ſelf, or matter complained of, touching Gods forſaking of him: Chriſt was forſaken of God in ſome ſort, and he was very ſenſible of his Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, though it was but in part, and for a time, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> This forſaking is not to be underſtood of his whole perſon, but of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only according to which, and in the which he now ſuffered on the Croſs. Though the perſon of Chriſt ſuffered, and was forſaken, yet he was not forſaken in, or according to his whole Perſon, but in reſpect of his humane nature only. The Godhead of Chriſt could not be forſaken, for then God ſhould have forſaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which is impoſſible. The perſonal union of the God head with the Man-hood of Chriſt, continued all the time of his paſſion and death, it was never diſſolved, nor ever ſhall be; yea the Godhead did uphold the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood all the time of Chriſts ſufferings, ſo that he was not forſaken, when he was forſaken; he was not forſaken wholly, when he was forſaken in part. The love and favour of God the Father towards Jeſus Chriſt did not ebb and flow, riſe and fall; for God never loved Jeſus Chriſt more, or better than at the time of his paſſion, when he was moſt obedient to his Fathers will. <hi>(There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 10. 17.</note> 
               <hi>for my Sheep.)</hi> Chriſt had never more of the ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence of his Father, than when he had leaſt of his comfortable preſence; when Chriſt was in his grievous agony, and diſtreſs of body and mind, the Godhead did withdraw the comfortable preſence from the manhood, and ſo far, and ſo far only was Chriſt forſaken. Though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104355:68"/> the union was not diſſolved, yet there was a ſuſpenſion of viſion for the time, ſo as the humane nature did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee or feel any preſent comfort from God: Now ſo far as the Godhead did withdraw its comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſo far our Saviour was forſaken and no further, that was but in part, and therefore he was but in part forſaken: God was really preſent with Chriſt, when in reſpect of his comfortable preſence he was withdrawn from him. So here: The Husband may be in the houſe, and the Wife not know it; the Sun may ſhine, and I not ſee it; there may be fire in the Room, and I not feel it, ſo God may be really preſent with his People, when he is not ſenſibly preſent with his People. But</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this, That the favourable, <note place="margin">2.

And they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God.</hi> Verſe 40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Verſe 41. <hi>Yea I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over them, to do them good.</hi> There are many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſſes of the Divine preſence, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, but they are all entailed upon Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-people: We are all the People of God by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both good and bad, ſinners and ſaints, bond and free, rich and poor, high and low; and we are all the People of God by outward profeſſion. All that do make an outward profeſſion of God, and perform external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God; they are all the People of God in this ſence; all the Carnal Iſraelites, are frequently called the People of God, as well as the ſpiritual Seed; thus <hi>Cain</hi> was one of Gods People as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as well as <hi>Jacob.</hi> Now ſuch as are only the People of God by creation, or by profeſſion, theſe are ſtrangers to God, theſe are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 12.</note> to God, and will he be favourably preſent with

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104355:69"/> the wine of aſtoniſhment. And will God dwell with theſe? will he keep houſe with theſe? ſurely no. By theſe ſhort hints it is moſt evident, that the ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is entailed upon none out of Covenant; <note place="margin">Joh 14. 21, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Though the Saints have not alwayes the comforting preſence of God in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, yet they have always the ſupporting preſence of God in their afflictions, as Chriſt in his bitter and <note place="margin">Mat. 27 46. My Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104355:70"/> God; His left hand is under their heads, and his right <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 6.</note> hand doth embrace them, when in reſpect of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting preſence, they may ſay with the weeping Prophet <note place="margin">Lam. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Comforter that ſhould relieve my ſoul, is far from me.</hi> When the love-ſick Spouſe was ready to faint, Chriſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleth her with amiable embracements. <hi>His left hand is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her head, and his right hand doth embrace her.</hi> It is an alluſion to their conjugal and menſal beds, on which the gueſts are ſo beſtowed, that the firſt laid his left hand under the head of him that was next, and put him ſo in in his boſom, that with his other hand he might alſo, if he pleaſed, embrace him, which was a poſture and ſign of the greateſt love, which the ſick fainting Spouſe here glories in. Chriſts two hands are teſtimonies and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his great power and might, who is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his People (though lame creeples) from falling, &amp; alſo to lift them up again, when they are fallen never ſo low, and likewiſe to ſupport and uphold them, that they ſhall never finally and utterly be caſt down. When the hearts of the Saints are ready to faint and ſink, then the Lord will employ all his power for their ſupport, bearing them up as it were with both hands. He hath put his left hand under my head as a pillow to reſt upon, and with his right hand he hath embraced me, as a loving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 29.</note> cheriſheth his ſick Wife, and doth her all the help he can. The beſt of Saints would fail, and faint in a day of trouble, if Chriſt did not put to both his hands to keep them up. In dayes of ſorrow Gods People ſtands in need of a whole Chriſt to ſupport them and uphold them. My head ſinks, O my Beloved, put thy left hand ſofter than pillowes of roſes, firmer than pillars of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, under it; my heart faileth and dyeth, O let thy right hand embrace me. But,</p>
            <p>The fourth propoſition is this, that all Saints have <note place="margin">4 Propoſition.</note> not a like meaſure of the preſence of the Lord in their troubles and tryals, in their ſorrows and ſufferings; ſome have more, and others have leſs of this preſence of God in an evil day. 1. All Saints have not a like work
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104355:70"/> to do in an evil day. 2. All Saints have not alike tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to withſtand in an evil day. 3. All Saints have not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like teſtimony to give in an evil day. 4. All Saints have not alike burdens to bear in an evil day. 5. All Saints have <note place="margin">Lam. 1. 12. cap. 4. 6. Dan. 9. 12, 13. 2 Cor. 11. 21. to the end. Heb. 11 25. to the end.</note> not alike things to ſuffer in an evil day. There are greater and there are leſſer troubles, diſtreſſes and dangers; and there are ordinary troubles, diſtreſſes and dangers, and there are extraordinary troubles, diſtreſſes and dangers: Now where the trouble, the diſtreſs, the danger is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, there an ordinary preſence of God may ſuffice; but <note place="margin">Dan. 3. Dan. 6.</note> where the trouble, the diſtreſs, the danger is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, there the People of God ſhall have an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſence of God with them, as you may ſee in the three Children, <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Apoſtles, the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the Book of Martyrs. Some troubles, diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and dangers are but of a ſhort continuance, as <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> ſaid of his baniſhment, <hi>Nubecula eſt, citò tranſibit, It is but a little cloud, and will quickly be gone.</hi> Others are of a longer continuance, and accordingly God ſuits his preſence. All Saints have not a like outward ſuccours, ſupplies, reliefes, comforts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their troubles, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes and dangers; ſome have a ſhelter, a friend at hand, others have not; ſome have many friends, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may cry out with him, O my friends, I have never a friend! ſome are ſurrounded with outward comforts, and others have not one, not one penny, not one friend, not one days work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a ſtorm ſome have good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at hand, others are near the rocks, and in danger of being ſwallowed up in the ſands: ſo here, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly God lets out more or leſs of his preſence among his People, ſome need more of his preſence than others do, and accordingly God diſpenceth it among his Saints. But,</p>
            <p>The fift propoſition is this, that none of the Saints <note place="margin">5 Propoſition.</note> have at all times in all afflictions, diſtreſſes and dangers, <note place="margin">Some ſcores of Pſalms do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the truth of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the ſame meaſure and degree of the preſence of the Lord, but in one affliction they have more, in another leſs of the Divine preſence; in one affliction a Chriſtian may
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104355:71"/> have more of the enlightning preſence of God than in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and in another affliction a Chriſtian may have more of the comforting preſence of God, than in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; in this trouble a Chriſtian may have more of the awakning preſence of God, than in another, and in that trouble a Chriſtian may have more of the ſanctifying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, than in another; and in this diſtreſs a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may have more of the ſupporting preſence of God, than in that. No one Saint doth at all times, nor in all troubles need a like meaſure of the Divine preſence. The primitive Chriſtians and the Martyrs had ſometimes more and ſometimes leſs of the Divine preſence with them, as their condition did require. God who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly wiſe, does alwayes ſuit the meaſures and degrees of his gracious, favourable, ſignal preſence to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of his Saints. This is ſo clear and great a truth, that there are many thouſands that can ſeal to it, from their own experience; and therefore I need not enlarge upon it. But,</p>
            <p>The ſixth and the laſt propoſition is this, that many <note place="margin">6 Propoſition.</note> precious Chriſtians in their great troubles, deep diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and moſt deadly dangers, may have this favourable, ſignal and eminent preſence of God with them, and yet fear and doubt, yea peremptorily conclude that they have <note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus I have laid down theſe ſix propoſitions, which if well weighed and improved, may many ways be of ſingular uſe to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now come to the application or uſeful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this great and ſeaſonable Truth. Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the drawing of the Bow, but application is the hitting of the mark, the white. Is it ſo, that when the People of the Lord are in great troubles, deep diſtreſſes,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104355:72"/> and moſt deadly dangers, that then the Lord will be favourably, ſignally and eminently preſent with them; Then let me briefly infer theſe ten things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Saints are a People of Chriſts ſpecial <note place="margin">1 Inference.</note> care. 2 Chron. 16. 9. <hi>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole Earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them, whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi> The words contain. 1 The univerſality of Gods providence, his eyes walk the rounds, they run to and fro through the whole Earth, to defend and ſecure the ſincere in heart. <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple was burnt down, when ſhe was buſied at <hi>Alexander</hi>'s birth, and could not be at two places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but God is preſent at all times, in all places, and among all perſons, and therefore his Church, which is <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 16. cap. 6. 19.</note> his Temple, can never ſuffer through his abſence. The Egyptians had an Idol, called <hi>Baal-Zephon,</hi> which is by interpretation, <hi>Dominus ſpeculae, Lord of the Watch-tower;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 2.</note> his office was, to fright ſuch fugitive Jews as ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſteal out of the Country; but when <hi>Moſes</hi> and the People of Iſrael paſt that way, and pitched their camp there, this drowſy God was ſurely faſt a ſleep, for they all marched on their way without let or moleſtation. <note place="margin">Pſalm 121. 3, 4, 5 Iſa. 27. 3, 4.</note> Whereas he that keepeth Iſrael <hi>Neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth;</hi> he kept his Iſrael then, and he hath kept his Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ever ſince; he made good his title then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will make good his title ſtill, he ever was and he ever will be watchful over his People for their good. 2. The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his providence, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong; God fights with his eyes as well as his hands, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee his Peoples dangers, but ſaves them from dangers <note place="margin">Zach. 2. 5.</note> in the midſt of dangers. When the Philoſopher in a ſtarry night was in danger of drowning, he cried out, Surely I ſhall not periſh there are ſo many eyes of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over me. King <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, He could ſleep ſafely, <note place="margin">Pſalm 3. 5, 6.</note> becauſe his friend <hi>Antipater</hi> watched for him. O how much more may the Saints ſleep ſafely, who have always a God that keepes watch and ward about them. God <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 10.</note> is ſo ſtrong a Tower that no cannon can pierce it, and he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104355:73"/> is ſo high a Tower that no ladder can ſcale it, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is ſo deep a Tower that no pioneer can undermine it; and therefore they muſt needs be ſafe and ſecure, who lodge within a Tower ſo impregnable, ſo inexpugnable. Now this is the caſe of all the Saints, the fatherly care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is ſtill exerciſed for the good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Deut. 32. 10. <hi>He found him in a deſart Land, and in</hi>

The Eagle carries her young ones upon her wings (and not between her talons as other birds do) openly, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſwiftly; and ſo did God his Iſrael, being choice and chary of them all the way, ſecuring them alſo from their enemies, who could do them as little hurt, as any can <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 4. 5. 6. cap. 59. 16.</note> do the Eagles young, which cannot be ſhot but through the body of the old one: See at what a rate God ſpeaks in that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27, 28. Obſerve how God comes on with his high interrogatories, <hi>Haſt thou not known?</hi> What an ignorant People! <hi>Haſt thou not heard?</hi> What a deaf Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! what keep no intelligence with Heaven! 1 Pet. 5. 7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> I will now with you ſing away care (ſaid <hi>John Careleſs,</hi>

I have caſt my care upon the Lord, which careth for me, and will be careleſs according to my name. It was a ſtrange ſpeech of <hi>Socrates,</hi> a Heathen, Since God is ſo careful of you (ſaith he) what need you be careful for any thing your ſelves? Gods providence extendeth to all his Creatures; it's like the Sun of univerſal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but in a ſpecial manner it's operative for the ſafety of his Saints. In common dangers men take ſpecial care of their Jewels, and will not God, will not God take <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17. Heb. 3. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> ſpecial care of his Jewels? ſurely yes.

            <p>Secondly, Will the Lord be ſignally preſent with his <note place="margin">2. Inference.</note> People, in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes and moſt deadly dangers, then here you may ſee the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Saints are ſo comfortable, cheerful and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <note place="margin">Acts 5. 40, 41. Cap. 16. 25. Rom. 5. 3. 2 Cor. 7. 4.

It was this ſignal preſence of God with the Martyrs, that made them rejoyce in the midſt of their greateſt ſufferings, and that made them endure great ſufferings, without any ſenſible feeling of their ſufferings: As that young Child in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who when his fleſh was pulled in pieces with pincers, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſaid with a ſmiling countenance:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104355:74"/> Tyrant, thou loſeſt time, where are thoſe ſmarting pains with which tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> threatnedſt me? make me to ſhrink, and cry out if thou canſt? And <hi>Bainam,</hi> an Engliſh Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, when the fire was flaming about him, ſaid: You Papiſts talk of Miracles, behold here a Miracle, I feel no more pain than if I were in a bed of down, it is as ſweet to me as a bed of Roſes. Surely their ſtrength <note place="margin">Job 6. 12.</note> was not the ſtrength of ſtones, nor their fleſh of braſs, that they ſhould not be ſenſible of ſo great ſufferings; but this was only from that ſignal preſence of God, that made them endure grievous pains without pain, <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 33. to 35.</note> and moſt exquiſit torments without torment, and ſore ſufferings without feeling of their ſufferings; and other choice ſouls there were, who though they were ſenſible of their ſufferings, yet by the Divine preſence they were filled with unſpeakable courage, comfort and alacrity. <hi>Laurence</hi> when his body was roaſted upon a burning Gridi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, cryed out, This ſide is roaſted enough, turn the other. <hi>Marcus</hi> of <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> a worthy Miniſter, when his body was cut and lanced, and anointed with honey, and hung up a loft in a Basket, to be ſtung to death by Waſps and Bees, he looking down cheerfully upon the the Spectators ſaid, I am advanced, deſpiſing you that are below; and when we ſhall ſee poor, weak, feeble Creatures like our ſelves, defying their tormenters and their torments, conquering in the midſt of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſufferings, and rejoycing and triumphing in the midſt of their fiery trials, ſinging in Priſon, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did; kiſſing the ſtake as <hi>Henry Voes</hi> did; clapping their hands when they were half conſumed in the flames as <hi>John Noyes</hi> did; calling their execution day, their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day as Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> did. We cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they had a ſingular preſence of God with them, that made all their ſufferings ſeem ſo eaſie and ſo light unto them. <hi>Caeſar</hi> cheered up his drooping Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners in a ſtorm, by minding them of his preſence; but alaſs! alaſs! what was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s preſence to this Divine, this ſignal preſence that the Saints have enjoyed in their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104355:74"/> greateſt troubles, and deepeſt diſtreſſes. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Will the Lord be ſignally preſent with his <note place="margin">3. Inference.</note> People, in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers; then from hence you may ſee the weakneſs, madneſs, ſottiſhneſs, and folly of all ſuch as <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 9, 10. Cap. 27. 4. 1 Cor. 1. 25.</note> make oppoſition againſt the Saints; that affront, injure, and make head againſt thoſe that have the preſence of the great God in the midſt of them. O Sirs! <hi>the weakneſs of God is ſtronger than Men.</hi> What then is the ſtrength of God? 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 22. Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we ſtronger than he?</hi> Ah who knows the power of his <note place="margin">Pſalm 90. 11.</note> anger! It is ſuch that none of the Potentates of the world, who ſet themſelves againſt the Saints, can avert or avoid, avoid or abide: That God is a mighty God, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do abundantly evidence, and it appears alſo in the Epithet, that is added unto <hi>El-,</hi> which is <hi>Gibbor,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that he is a God of prevailing might. By <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> he is called <hi>El-Elim, the mighty of mighties.</hi> Now what folly and madneſs is it for Duſt and Aſhes, for crawling Worms, to make head againſt a mighty God; yea an Almighty God, who can curſe them, and cruſh <note place="margin">Geneſ. 49. 25.

In <hi>Diocleſian's</hi> time, under whom was the laſt and worſt of the ten perſecutions, though then Chriſtian Religion was more deſperately oppoſed than ever, yet ſuch was the preſence of God with his <note place="margin">Ruffin.</note> People in thoſe times, that Religion proſpered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed more than ever; ſo that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the more he ſought to blot out the name of Chriſt, it became the more legible, and to block up the way of Chriſt it became the more paſſable; and what ever of Chriſt he thought to root out, it rooted the deeper and roſe the higher, thereupon he reſolved to engage himſelf no further, but retired to a private life: This is a good copy for the Perſecutors of the day to <note place="margin">Acts 5. 38, 39, 40 Pſalm 76. 12.

O Sirs! what folly and madneſs is it for weakneſs to engage againſt ſtrength, the Creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Creator, an Arm of fleſh againſt the Rock of Ages? What is the chaff to the whirl-wind, ſtubble and ſtraw to the devouring flames? no more are all the Enemies of <hi>Zion</hi> to the great and glorious God, that is ſignally preſent with his People in their greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and deepeſt diſtreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There was not one of thoſe perſecuting Emperours, that carried on the ten bloody Perſecutions againſt the Saints, but ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The love of God to his People is engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the moſt afflictive diſpenſation they are under: when he ſmartly rebukes them, even then he dearly loves them. <hi>(Hear ye the rod.)</hi> Oh, the rod ſpeaks love; <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 19.

That's excellent counſel that the wiſeſt Prince that ever ſwayed a ſcepter gives in that.

            <p>The next uſe is a uſe of exhortation, to exhort all the <note place="margin">2 Uſe.</note> People of God, ſo to order and demean themſelves as to keep the Divine preſence, as to keep the ſignal, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular preſence of God with them in their greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers. Now that this may ſtick in power upon your ſouls, conſider ſeriouſly of theſe following motives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſignal preſence of God with his People puts <note place="margin">1 Motive.</note> the greateſt honour, dignity and glory upon a People; imaginable. There are many titles of honour amongſt men, but this above all is the truly honourable title, that <note place="margin">Vide Iſa. 43. 2, 4 Jer. 13. 11. Ezek. ult. and ult.</note> we have God ſo near unto us, Deut. 4. 7. <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is to us?</hi> Whiles he vouchſafed his preſence amongſt them, how honourable, how renowned were they all the world over! But when he departed from them, they became the ſcorn and contempt of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It may be ſaid of ſome men, they have large E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but not the preſence of God with them, they are highly honoured and dignified in the world, but no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with them, they have great trades and vaſt riches, but no preſence of God with them, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly related, but no preſence of God with them, they have ſingular parts and natural accompliſhments, but no preſence of God with them; the want of the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence gives a daſh caſts a blot upon all their grandures &amp; worldly glory, and like Coprice turnes all their wine (be it never ſo rich) into ink and blackneſs. What a deal of honour and glory did the preſence of God caſt upon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 39. 19, 20.</note> in priſon! and upon <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den! and upon the three Children in the fiery Furnace! and upon the three Children in the fiery Furnace! and upon <hi>David,</hi>

Acts 24. 25.</note> when a perſecuting <hi>Sanl</hi> could cry out, <hi>Thou art more righteous than I!</hi> and upon <hi>John,</hi> when a bloody <hi>Herod</hi> feared him, and obſerved him! and upon <hi>Paul,</hi> when a tyrannical <hi>Felix</hi> trembled before him, as if <hi>Paul</hi> had been
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104355:83"/> the Judge and <hi>Felix</hi> the priſoner at the bar! Some write of the Chryſtal, that what ſtone ſo ever it toucheth, it puts a luſtre and lovelineſs upon it: The preſence of God puts the greateſt luſtre, beauty, glory and lovelineſs that can be put upon a perſon. Now becauſe the witneſs of an Adverſary is a double teſtimony, let <hi>Baalant</hi> (who as ſome write of a Toad, had a Pearl in his head, though his heart was naught, very naught, ſtark naught) give <note place="margin">Num. 24. 5.</note> in his evidence. <hi>How goodly are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles, O Iſrael?</hi> He ſpeaks both by way of interrogation, and admiration; their Tents are ſo comely and their Tabernaeles ſo lovely, that their grand enemy was affected &amp; raviſhed with them. But whence is it that Iſrael is ſo formidable and terrible in his eye? how comes this about, that he who came to fight againſt them, thinks them beyond all compare, nay doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf admire their poſtures and order, their great glory &amp; brave gallantry, why all is from the preſence of their Lord-General with them? The Lord their God is with <note place="margin">Num. 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is the higheſt honour, renown and dignity of a People to have God in the midſt of them, to have God near unto them; Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets out the honour and dignity of the Jews, Deut. 26. 18. <hi>The Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar People,</hi> Verſe 19. <hi>To make thee high, above all Nations which he hath made, in praiſe, and in name, and in honour.</hi> When God reckons up the dignities of his People, this is the main the top of all, Pſalm 87. 5. <hi>And of Sion it ſhall be ſaid, this and that man was born in her, and the Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi> If you would keep your honour and dignity, keep the preſence of God in the midſt of you; when God is departed from Iſrael, then you may write <hi>Ichabod</hi> upon Iſrael, <hi>The glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>from Iſrael.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To move you ſo to order demean, and <note place="margin">2 Motive.</note> carry your ſelves as you may enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you, in your greateſt troubles, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtreſſes, conſider that nothing can make up the

I am ſure our ſafety, our comfort, our all lyes in the ſignal preſence of God with us; and therefore let us by Faith and Prayer chain God to us, if we let him go, a thouſand worlds cannot make up his abſence. I ſuppoſe you have heard of the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of the Heathens in <hi>Troy,</hi> they imagined that ſo long as that Idol was kept ſafe, they were inconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all the ſtrength and power of <hi>Greece</hi> were never able to prevail againſt them; whrefore the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſought by all the means they could to get it from them. O my Friends, ſo long as you keep the preſence of God with you, I am ſure you are unconquerable; but if God withdraw his preſence, the weakeſt Enemy will be too hard for you, yea wounded men will prevail over you. <hi>Jer. 37. 10.

Such a perſon ſets the higheſt price and value imaginable upon it, he prizes it above all the honours, riches, dignities, delights, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and contents of this world. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. 6, 7. Yea he prizes it above life it ſelf. <hi>Pſalm 63. 3. Thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life;</hi> the Hebrew is plural <hi>Chajim, lives:</hi> The loving kindneſs of God, the preſence of God in a wilderneſs is better than lives, than many lives, than all lives with the appurtenances: There is a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the favour of God, in the preſence of God, than in all lives put together: There have been many Perſons that have been weary of their lives, but there <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 4. Job 7. 15. Jona 4. 8. Prov. 28. 14.</note> never was any man that has been weary of the favour of God, of the preſence of God. 2. Such a Perſon keeps up in his ſoul an humble fear of loſing of it. The Divine preſence is a Jewel more worth than all the world, and he that has experienced the ſweetneſs of it, had rather loſe all he has in this world than loſe it. I have read of a Religious woman, that having born nine Children,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104355:85"/> profeſſed that ſhe had rather endure all the pains of thoſe nine Travels at once, than endure the miſery of the loſs of Gods preſence. 3. Such a perſon keeps up in his ſoul a diligent care to maintain this preſence, his head, his heart is ſtill a contriving how he may keep his God with him. <hi>Jerem. 14. 4. Why ſhouldeſt thou be as a man aſtonied, as a mighty man that cannot ſave? yet thou, O Lord are in the midſt of us, and we are called by thy Name, leave us not.</hi> This Perſon had rather that his deareſt Friends ſhould leave him, that his neareſt Relations ſhould leave him; yea that all the world ſhould leave him than that his God ſhould leave him: The daily, yea the hourly language of his ſoul is, Lord leave me not, though all the world ſhould leave me, yet don't thou leave me. 4. Such a Perſon will do all he can, that all under his <note place="margin">John 1. 40. to the end. Cap. 4. 28. to 43. Acts 10. 24. to 36. Judges 14. 8, 9.</note> care and charge may partake of this ſignal preſence of God, he will do his utmoſt that Children, Yoak-fellow, Kindred, Servants may taſt the ſweetneſs of the Divine preſence. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> had found honey in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs of the Lion, he did not only eat himſelf, but he gave of the honey to his Father and Mother, and they did eat alſo; of all ſweets the preſence of God is the greateſt ſweet, and when ever a poor ſoul comes to taſt of this heavenly honey, he will do his beſt that all others (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that are near and dear to him) may taſt of the ſame honey. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To move you ſo to order, demean and carry <note place="margin">4.

            <p>Fifthly, To move you ſo to order demean and carry <note place="margin">5 Motive.</note> your ſelves, as that you may enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you, in your greateſt troubles and deepeſt diſtreſſes, conſider that in great troubles, deep diſtreſſes and moſt deadly dangers, you will moſt need the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſignal preſence of God with you. We alwayes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104355:87"/> ſtand in need of the Divine preſence, but never ſo much as when we are under great troubles and deep diſtreſſes; For, 1. In dayes of trouble and diſtreſs mens affections are moſt apt to be greatly diſordered, and their hearts diſcompoſed, as you ſee in <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jonah.</hi> 2. Now their <note place="margin">Job 3. Jonah 4.</note> fears, doubts, and diſputes are apt to riſe higheſt; when the wind riſes high and the ſea roares, men are moſt apt <note place="margin">Jonah 2. 2. to 7.</note> to be afraid. 3. Now Satan commonly is buſieſt, Satan <note place="margin">Job 2. 9. Jam. 1. 12.</note> loves to fiſh in troubled waters; when the hand of God is heavieſt upon us, then Satan will ſhoot his moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 25. Deu. 25. 17, 18, 19.</note> darts at us. The ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> fell upon the <hi>Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> when they were ſore; and <hi>Amaleck</hi> fell upon Gods Iſrael and ſmote them, when they were weak, and feeble, and faint and weary; and Satan falls foul upon Chriſt, <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 1. to 11.</note> when he was in the wilderneſs, and when he had faſted forty dayes and forty nights, and was a hungry; And as he dealt with the head, ſo he ſtill deales with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 4. Now unbelief is moſt turbulent, ſtrong, and mighty in operation, as you may ſee in the Spies, <hi>We be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 13. 31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>not able to go up againſt the people, for they are ſtronger than we. The Land through which we have gone to ſearch it, is a Land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the</hi>

               <hi>people that we ſaw in it are men of great ſtature; And there we ſaw the Giants, the Sons of Anak, which come of the Giants, and we were in our own ſight as Graſhoppers, and ſo we were in their ſight.</hi> So 2 Kings 6. 33. <hi>This evil is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vide 2 Kin. 7. 1, 2. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> So <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 116. 11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt all men are lyars,</hi> the Prophets have all deceived me, and <hi>Samuel</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded me, they have told me of a Kingdom, a Crown, but I ſhall never wear the one, nor poſſeſs the other. So 1 Sam. 27. 1. <hi>I ſhall now periſh one day by the hand of Saul;</hi> Thus his fear is got above his faith, and his ſoul wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with unbelief, to the ſcandal of the weak, and the ſcorn of the wicked, beſides his own particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. 5. Now fainting fits will be moſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, increaſed, and multiplyed. Now fainting fits like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſengers, or like the rolling waves, will come
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104355:88"/> thick one upon another, <hi>Prov. 24. 10. Job 4. 5. Lam.</hi> 1. 12, 13. 6. Now conſcience will be moſt ſtartled &amp; diſquieted, <hi>Gen. 42. 21. cap. 50. 15. 1 Kings</hi> 17. 18. Great troubles and deep diſtreſſes are many times like ſtrong phyſick, which ſtirs the humours and makes the Patient ſick, very ſick, yea heart ſick. Conſcience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly never reades the ſoul ſuch ſad and ſerious lectures as when the Rod lyes heavieſt upon the back. By all which you ſee, what high cauſe the People of God have ſo to order, demean and carry themſelves, as that they may find the gracious preſence of God with them in their greateſt troubles, and deepeſt diſtreſſes, for then they will certainly need moſt of the Divine preſence.

Why? <hi>God is in the midſt of her, ſhe ſhall not be moved, God ſhall help her, and that right early.</hi> Verſe 5. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge, Selah.</hi> Verſ. 7.

Now is God ſo unwilling to withdraw his preſence, and ſhall not we do all what we can to retain him in the midſt of us? When dear Friends are unwilling to leave us, we are the more earneſt in preſſing them to ſtay and abide with us; God is marvellouſly unwilling to go, and therefore let us with the Church cry out, <hi>Leave us not,</hi> Jerem. 14. 9.

The ſignal prefence of God with his People is a moſt ſoveraign antidote againſt all the curſes and curſings of curſed men, and therefore what ever you part with, be ſure you don't part with your God, let him be but in the midſt of you, and then no curſes ſhall be prevalent againſt you.

Some of the Rabbies write, that Manna had all ſorts of taſts, and all ſorts of ſweets in it: Sure I am, that the favourable preſence of God has <note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6, 7.</note> all ſorts of ſweets in it, it has the ſweet of all ordinances in it, it has the ſweet of all duties in it, it has the ſweet of <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> all Church priviledges in it, it has the ſweet of all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104355:91"/> in it, it has the ſweet of all your outward comforts in it, and therefore above all keeping, keep the preſence of God with you. Many in their diſtreſſes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries are full of complaints; one cries out, he wants a faithful Friend; another cries out, he wants an active Relation; a third cries out, that he wants neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As <hi>Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah, Am not I better than ten Sons?</hi> So aſſuredly the preſence of the Lord is wonderfully better than all other things to every ſoul that has taſted the ſweetneſs of it.

Let thy wants and thy croſſes be never ſo great, thy afflictions never ſo preſſing, thy neceſſities never ſo biting, thou haſt no juſt cauſe to be troubled or dejected, ſo long as thou art in favour with God, and enjoyeſt the preſence of God. All mercies, all comforts, all contentments, all enjoyments they meet and center in the gracious preſence of God, as all lights meet in the Sun, and as all waters meet in the Sea, and therefore let not that ſoul mourn or complain of the want of any thing, who enjoyes that gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that is better than every terre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thing. Thus much for the motives.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, O Sir, what means ſhould we uſe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104355:91"/> that we may enjoy the gracious preſence of the Lord with us in our greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers? I anſwer firſt there are ſome things that you muſt carefully ſhun and take heed off; As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, take heed of high ſinnings, take heed of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſins. High ſinnings do greatly diſhonour God, wound conſcience, reproach Religion, ſtagger the weak, grieve the ſtrong, open the mouths of the wicked, and provoke God to withdraw his gracious preſence, <hi>Pſalm 51. 11, 12. Exod. 32. 8. Cap. 33. 3. Iſa.</hi> 63. 10. Turn to theſe Scriptures, and ſeriouſly ponder upon them. Great tranſgreſſions do eclypſe the favour of God, as well as the honour of God; In great tranſgreſſions we turn our backs upon God, and God turns away his face from us. Groſs ſins will provoke God to withdraw his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, both in reſpect of vigour and ſtrength, as alſo in reſpect of peace and comfort. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, take heed of impenitency. Next to our being preſerved from ſin, it is the greateſt mercy in the world, when we are fallen by our tranſgreſſions, to make a quick and ſpeedy return to God: When by your ſins <note place="margin">Hoſea 6. 1. Exod. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Peter</hi> did, and recovered the favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Mat. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>5. Mar. 16. 7.</note> preſence of God preſently. But if men will commit ſin, and lye in it, if they will fall, and have no mind to riſe, God will certainly withdraw his favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from them, as you ſee in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> This <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 11, 12. 1 Kings 11. 9. Joſh. 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</note> is further evident in that caſe of <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſh. 7: <hi>The Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites they came to fight with the men of Ai, and fled before them, for the Lord was not with them.</hi> Why, what was the cauſe of Gods withdrawing himſelf? See <hi>Verſe 11. Iſrael hath ſinned.</hi> And <hi>Verſe 12. Therefore the Children of Iſrael could not ſtand before their enemies, but turned their backs.</hi> Their ſins having betrayed them into the hand of Divine Juſtice, and into their enemies hands alſo; Mark
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104355:92"/> what followes, <hi>Neither will I be with you any more, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye deſtroy the accurſed from amongſt you.</hi> If we will not ſtone our <hi>Achans,</hi> our ſins, by the lively exerciſe of faith and repentance; If we will keep up our luſts in deſpite of all that God does againſt us, we muſt never expect to retain the gracious preſence of God with us. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, take heed either of neglecting Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or of corrupting Goſpel-worſhip. Omiſſions will damn as well as commiſſions, and omiſſions will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to withdraw his preſence, as well as commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. When perſons are careleſs in their attendance on <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 2, 3, 6. Cant. 4. 1, 2, 3.</note> Goſpel ordinances, no wonder if God withdraw his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from them in their diſtreſſes. <hi>Cain</hi> went off from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 15, 16.</note> and the Lord ſet a mark upon him. O the black and diſmal marks of miſery, that God has ſet upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have neglected Goſpel-worſhip, and for profits ſake, and for <hi>Diana's</hi> ſake are fallen roundly in with the <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10. Acts 19. 24, 36.</note> worſhip of the world! O Sirs, the great God ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing more in all the world than upon purity in his worſhip; There is nothing that doth ſo provoke &amp; exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate God againſt a People as corrupt worſhip; corrupt worſhip ſadly reflects upon the Name of God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, the truth of God, and the wiſdom of God, and therefore his heart riſes againſt ſuch worſhip and worſhippers, and he will certainly withdraw from them, and be a ſwift and terrible witneſs againſt them, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the margin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 39. to 43. Pſal. 78. 58. to 64. 2 Chro. 7. 19, 20, 21, 22. Cap. 32. 16. to 21 Deu. 29. 22. to 29</note> Corrupt worſhip is contrary to the unity of God; Now deny his unity, and you deny his Deity, <hi>For the Lord is one, and his Name is one,</hi> Zach. 14. 9. 'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſoveraignty of God, <hi>He is the only Ruler, the only Potentate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 15. 'Tis contrary to the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of God. The Heathen worſhipped ſeveral Gods, as thinking that ſeveral Gods did beſtow ſeveral bleſſings; they begged health of one God, wealth of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other God, and victory of a third God, thus imagining to themſelves ſeveral Deities, for ſeveral ſupplies; their God was but a <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a partial helper, an auxiliary
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104355:92"/> God, but <hi>Our God is Jehovah,</hi> who is abundantly able to <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 20.</note> ſupply all our wants. Now if either we neglect his true inſtituted worſhip, or fall in with a falſe worſhip, with a deviſed worſhip, with a humane worſhip, with a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip, he will certainly withdraw his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from us. Will-worſhip accuſes and charges God with weakneſs and folly, as if God were not careful <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 4, 5, 6. John 4. 23, 24.</note> enough, nor faithful enough, nor mindful enough, nor wiſe enough, to order, direct and guide his People in the matters of his worſhip, but muſt be beholding to the wiſdom, prudence, and care of man, of vain man, of ſinful man, of vile and unworthy man, of weak and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man, to compleat, perfect and make up ſomething that was wanting in his worſhip? Now aſſuredly, God will never keep houſe with them, who give in ſuch ſevere accuſations and charges againſt him. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, take heed of a willing willful and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous running croſs to Divine commands, to Divine warnings. The diſobedient child is turn'd out of doors, the diſobedient ſervant ſhall have none of his Maſters ſmiles, the diſobedient wife has little of her husbands company; a willing willful preſumptuous running croſs to Divine commands ſpeaks out much pride, Atheiſm, hardneſs, blindneſs, and deſperate ſecurity and contempt of the great God; It ſpeaks out the greateſt diſingenuity, ſtoutneſs, and ſtubornneſs that is imaginable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if God turn his back upon ſuch, and if he diſdains to be in the midſt of ſuch, <hi>Num. 14. 42. Go</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See Deu. 1. 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.</note> 
               <hi>not up, for the Lord is not among you, that ye be not ſmitten before your enemies.</hi> Verſe 43. <hi>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,</hi> (that is, on the top of the hill, lying in readineſs to ſet upon you, and therefore are ſaid, <hi>To come down,</hi> Verſe 45) <hi>And ye ſhall fall by the ſword, becauſe ye are turned away from the Lord, therefore the Lord will not be with you,</hi> Verſe 44. But they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to go up to the hill-top, though they had not the preſence of God with them, nor the ſigns of his grace &amp; favour with them, nor the company of <hi>Moſes</hi> with them,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104355:93"/> but mark, they paid dear for their preſumption. Verſe 45. <hi>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and ſmote them, and diſcomfited them even unto Hormah.</hi> When men are without Gods preſence, they are without Gods precincts, and ſo out of his protection. To act or run croſs to Gods expreſs command (though under pretence of revelation from God) is as much as a mans life is worth, as you may ſee in that ſad ſtory. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 24. We frequently deny our preſence unto diſobedient Perſons, and ſo does God his; diſobedience to Divine commands ſhuts the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Divine preſence, and will not ſuffer God to come in to ſuccour us, comfort us, or ſupport us, under our greateſt troubles, and deepeſt diſtreſſes. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Take heed of carnal confidence, of reſting upon an arm of fleſh. <hi>Pſalm 30. 6. And in my proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved;</hi> that is, when I was proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when <hi>Job</hi> on the dunghil was a conqueror.</note> ſettled in the Kingdom, I began to conclude within my ſelf, that now there was an end of all my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, I ſhould now live all my dayes in a proſperous eſtate. <hi>David</hi> having taken the ſtrong Fort of <hi>Zion,</hi> and having vanquiſhed his Enemies round about, and all the Tribes having ſubmitted themſelves to him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving built a fair Palace, and being quietly ſettled in his Throne, he began to be puffed up with carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Oh the hazard of honour! Oh the damage of dignity! how ſoon are we broken upon the ſoft pillow of eaſe? Flies ſettle upon the ſweeteſt perfumes when cold; and ſo does ſin on the beſt hearts, when they are diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and disſpirited by proſperity. Oh how apt are the holieſt of men to be proud and ſecure, and promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more than ever God promiſed them, <hi>viz.</hi> Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the Croſs: He thought that his Kingdom and all proſperity was tyed unto him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ords of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, he ſitting quietly at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and free from <note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 1.</note> fear of all his Enemies; but God quickly confutes his carnal confidence, by giving him to know, that he could as eaſily blaſt the ſtrongeſt Oak, as he could trample the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104355:93"/> ſmalleſt Worm under his feet. Verſe 7. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> God will quickly ſuſpend his favour, and withdraw his preſence, when his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begin to be proud and carnally confident. Look as at the Eclipſe of the Sun the whole frame of nature droops; ſo when God hides his face, when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his preſence, the beſt of Saints cannot but droop, and hang down their heads. So <hi>Jerem. 17. 5. Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>For he ſhall be like the heath in the deſart, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Take heed of barrenneſs and unfruitfulneſs under Goſpel Ordinances, turn to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 1, to 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 34, to 42. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 16. to the laſt.

            <p>Eighthly, Take heed of a flothful, lazy, trifling Spirit in the things of God: <hi>Cantic. 5. 2.

               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104355:95"/> Chriſts head is filled with dew, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt came to his Spouſe, full of the dew of ſpiritual and heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: Chriſt alwayes brings meat in his mouth, and a <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3, 4. Revel. 22. 12.</note> reward in his hand: Chriſt never viſits his People empty handed; he is no beggarly or niggardly Gueſt, when he comes he brings every thing that heart can wiſh or need require; and now ſtand and wonder at the ſilly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <note place="margin">Cap. 3. 17, 19.</note> that the Spouſe makes for her ſelf: Trouble me not for I am in bed, my clothes are off, my feet are waſhed, and I am compoſed to a ſettled reſt: But are you ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? (might Chriſt have replied) Is this your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 17.</note> to your friend? is this the part and poſture of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant Chriſtian? would it not have been much better for you to have had your loyns girt, your lamp burning, and you waiting for your Lords return? Is it ſo great a trouble? Is it ſuch a mighty buſineſs for you to riſe out of your bed, to put on your clothes, and to let in ſuch a Gueſt, as comes not to take any thing from you, but to enrich you with the beſt and nobleſt of favours? Now mark how ſeverely Chriſt puniſhes his Spouſes ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lazyneſs, ſlothfulneſs, and delayes to entertain him when he knocked. Verſe 6. <hi>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone: my ſoul failed when he ſpake; I ſought him but I could not find him: I called him but he gave no anſwer;</hi> or he was gone, he was gone, a moſt paſſionate complaint for his departure, or my beſt beloved was departed, he was gone away: By the iteration or doubling of this ſentence, wherein the Spouſe complains of the departure of her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, is ſignified her great trouble, her hearty ſorrow, her inexpreſſible grief, that lay as a heavy load upon her ſpirit, becauſe by her unworthy uſage of him, ſhe had fooliſhly occaſioned him to withdraw his preſence from her. Spiritual deſertions are of three ſorts: 1. Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for preventing of ſin as <hi>Pauls</hi> ſeems to be. 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bational <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 2, 8, 9.</note> for trial and exerciſe of grace. 3.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104355:95"/> and therefore as ever you would enjoy the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, take heed of a lazy, ſlothful, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh ſpirit, in the things of God, in the concernments of your ſouls. That man muſt needs be miſerable, that is lazy and ſlothful, and had rather go ſleeping to hell, than ſweating to heaven. But</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Take heed of a covetous worldly ſpirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſmarting Rod, under the ſevere rebukes of God. <hi>Iſa. 57. 17. For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs I was wroth and ſmote him; I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> Covetouſneſs was the common ſin of the Jews, this diſeaſe had infected all ſorts and ranks of men, this Leproſie did ſpread it ſelf over <note place="margin">Iſai. 56. 11. Jer. 6. 13. Cap. 8. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> Princes, Prophets and Prople, as you may ſee in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Scriptures in the margin together. Now <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs being the root of all evil,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and the Darling ſin of the Nation, God is ſo provoked by it, that he firſt ſmites and then hides himſelf, as one that in diſpleaſure, having left one to the evil, and harſh uſage of ſome other withdraweth himſelf out of the way, and having ſhut himſelf up in his cloſet, will not be ſeen or ſpoken with. A worldly man makes the world his God, covetouſneſs is flat Idolatry: <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 5. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify therefore your members which are upon the earth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs which is Idolatry.</hi> Now though it be true that what ever a man loves moſt and beſt, that is his <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19. Iſa. 3. 16, to 25.</note> God, be it his belly, or his back; yet in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner covetouſneſs is Idolatry, ſo as no other ſin is. Three things eſpecially make a God: Firſt, our judgement, when we eſteem it in our ſerious thoughts to be our chiefeſt good, and that in which we place our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now the covetous man looks upon the riches of the world, as his heaven, his happineſs, his great all. Pope <hi>Silveſter</hi> placed ſo much happineſs in riches that, to enjoy the Popedom for ſeven years, he ſold his ſoul to the Devil. The People of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> placed ſo much of their happineſs in riches, and were ſo exceſſively
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104355:96"/> covetous, that they were buying and ſelling in their ſhops, even three dayes after the Turks were within the walls of the City, and that was the reaſon that the ſtreets run down with the blood of them, their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Secondly, Our confidence, that is a homage which makes a God, when we place our truſt in any thing, make it our rock, our fortreſs, our all-ſufficient good, this the covetous man doth: <hi>He ſaith to the wedge of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 21. 34.</note> 
               <hi>gold, thou art my confidence.</hi> The rich mans heart dances about his Golden-calf, ſaying to his <hi>wedg of gold, thou art my confidence;</hi> and yet his wedge of gold ſhall prove but as <hi>Achans</hi> wedge; a wedge to cleave his ſoul in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Joſhua 7. 21. to ult.</note> and as that Babyloniſh garment to be his winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet. <hi>[The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City.]</hi> Covetous <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 15. See 1 Tim. 6. 27.</note> perſons do really think themſelves ſimply the better, and the ſafer for their hoards and heaps of riches; but they may one day find themſelves greatly miſtaken. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 1.</note> is that ſtory of <hi>Croeſus</hi> among the Heathens, he was a great King, and tumbled up and down in his gold and ſilver, and <hi>Solon</hi> that wiſe man of <hi>Greece,</hi> coming into his Countrey, he deſired to ſpeak with him, and when he ſaw him, after <hi>Solon</hi> had ſeen and viewed all his wealth and glory, he asked him, whom he thought to be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man in the world, imagining that <hi>Solon</hi> would have ſaid <hi>Croeſus:</hi> But <hi>Solon</hi> anſwered, I think <hi>Tellus</hi> was the moſt happy man. <hi>Tellus,</hi> ſaith he; why <hi>Tellus?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid <hi>Solon,</hi> though he was poor, yet he was a good man, and content with that which he had; and having governed the Common-wealth well, and brought up his Child honeſtly and religiouſly, he died honourably. Well then, ſaid <hi>Croeſus,</hi> but who doeſt thou think the ſecond happy man in the world? I think, ſaid he, thoſe two Brothers, that inſtead of Horſes drew their Mother in a Chariot to the Temple. Whereupon ſaid <hi>Croeſus,</hi> what thinkeſt thou of me? I think, ſays he, thou art a very rich man; but a man may be happy though he be poor, and a man may be unhappy though he be rich, for he may loſe all his riches before he dye;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104355:96"/> and therefore <hi>Ante obitum nemo,</hi> I think none truly happy, but he that lives well, and dyes well: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that Wiſe man <hi>Solon</hi> was diſmiſſed the Court with neglect. But afterward this <hi>Croeſus</hi> making War againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he was overcome by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and being taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he was laid upon a pile of wood to be burned to death, then lying on the pile of wood, he cried out and ſaid: <hi>O Solon, Solon, Solon. Cyrus</hi> enquiring, what he meant? He anſwered, this <hi>Solon</hi> was a Wiſe man of <hi>Greece,</hi> that told me, that happineſs did not conſiſt in riches, for they might all be loſt, and a rich man might die miſerable: Whoſe words, ſaid he, I then neglected, but now I find true; and therefore now I cry out, O <hi>Solon, Solon, Solon!</hi> Let us now tell the covetous man, the worldly man, that his happineſs lyes not in riches, though he looks upon his riches as his ſtrong City; he won't mind us, he won't regard. O but there is a time a coming wherein the worldling will cry out: O <hi>Solon,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Solon, Solon!</hi> Thirdly, Our ſervice, that is a homage which makes a God, when we devote all our pains, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſervice to it, be it this or that, that makes a God: Now the covetous man his heart is moſt upon the world, his thoughts are moſt upon the world, his affections are moſt upon the world, and his diſcourſe is moſt about the world; he that hath his mind taken up with the world, and chiefly delighted with the world's muſick, he hath alſo his tongue tuned to the ſame Key, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his joy and comfort in ſpeaking of nothing elſe, but the world ard worldly things: If the world be in the heart it will break out at the lips; a worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man ſpeaketh of nothing but worldly things. <hi>[They</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>are of the world, therefore they ſpeak of the world.]</hi> The water riſeth not above the fountain; out of the ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe the ſhop is furniſhed; the love of this world makes men forget God, neglect Chriſt, ſlight Ordinances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 21, 22.</note> Heaven, deſpiſe holineſs, and oyles the tongue for worldly diſcourſes: Ah the time, the thoughts, the ſtrength, the ſpirits, the words that are ſpent upon the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104355:97"/> world, and the things of the world, whilſt ſinners ſouls lye a bleeding, and Eternity is poſting on upon them! I have read of a griping Uſurer, who was alwayes beſt when he was moſt in talking of the world, being near his end he was much preſt to make his will, at laſt he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and then he dictates to the Scrivener after this manner: Firſt, I bequeath my own ſoul to the Devil, for being ſo greedy of the muck of this world: Item, next I give my wifes ſoul to the Devil, for perſwading me to this courſe of life: Item I give the Parſon of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh's ſoul to the Devil, becauſe he did not ſhew me the danger I lived in, nor reprove me for it. O the danger of making the world our God, when we come to die, and to make up our accounts with God. Now when men make the world their God, and ſet up their riches, pleaſures, and profits in the place of God, no wonder if God withdraws his preſence from them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ever you would retain the gracious preſence of God with you, take heed of a covetous ſpirit, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit. But</p>
            <p>Tenthly and laſtly, As ever you would enjoy the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence of God with you in your greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, take heed of <note place="margin">See my Mute Chriſtian under the ſmarting rod.</note> a Croſs, froward, and inflexible Spirit under the Rod: When the Child is froward under the Rod, the Father withdraws; ſo here, <hi>Iſa. 57. 17.

And he ſaid, I will hide my face from them, for they are a very froward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> Heb. <hi>A generation of perverſneſſes.</hi> When the ſick man is froward, Friends withdraw and leave him alone, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. ver. 26. <hi>With the froward thou wilt</hi>

               <hi>ſhew thy ſelf froward.</hi> God will meet with froward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their own way, and make them reap the fruits of their own doings. God will walk croſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the froward, oppoſing and croſſing them in all they do. God has no delight to grace froward perſons with his preſence; when men begin to be froward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Divine hand, God commonly hides his face, and turns his back upon them; Men ſick of impatiency, are no fit company for the God of all patience; men that <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 5.

            <p>But Secondly, As there are many things to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, ſo there are ſeveral things to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as you would enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you, in your greateſt troubles, deepeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, let me glance at a few.</p>

And O, what glorious revelations and diſcoveries of God had he, when he was caught up into the third Heaven, into Paradiſe, &amp; heard unſpeakable words, or wordleſs words, ſuch as words were to weak to utter, <hi>Such as was not poſſible for man to utter,</hi> and that either becauſe they tranſcended mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in this life, or elſe becauſe the Apoſtle was forbid to utter them, they being revealed to him, not for the publick uſe of the Church, but only for his particular encouragment, that he might be the better able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with all hardſhips, difficulties, dangers and deaths, that did or might attend him in his Miniſterial <note place="margin">3 Cor. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10</note> work. Some of the Ancients are of opinion, that he ſaw Gods eſſence, for ſay they, other things in Heaven might have been uttered, but the eſſence of God is ſo great and ſo glorious a thing that no man or Angel can utter it. But here I muſt crave lieve to enter my diſſent from theſe learned men, for the Scripture is expreſs in this, <hi>That no man hath thus ever ſeen the Lord at any time, &amp; that no man</hi>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104355:99"/> But no man is bound to make this opinion an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his Faith; This I think we may ſafely conclude, that in this rapture, beſides the contemplation of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial myſteries, he felt ſuch unſpeakable delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that was either like to that, or exceeded that which <hi>Adam</hi> took in the Terreſtrial Paradiſe; Doubtleſs the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did ſee and hear ſuch excellent things, as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the tongue of any mortal man to expreſs, or utter. <hi>John was a burning and a ſhining Light,</hi> both in <note place="margin">John 5. 35.</note> life and doctrine; he was a man that kept up in his heart and life the power of holyneſs and godlineſs, and Chriſt reveales to him the general eſtate of his Church, and all that ſhould beſal his People, and that from <hi>John</hi>'s time unto his ſecond coming; Chriſt gives <hi>John</hi> a true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of all the troubles, tryals, changes, mercies and glories, that in all times, and in all ages and places ſhould attend his Church, until he came in all his glory. About ſixty years after Chriſts Aſcenſion, Chriſt comes to <hi>John,</hi> and opens his heart, and unboſomes his ſoul, <note place="margin">'Tis the general opinion of the learned, that this Book of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation was penned about the latter end of the reign of <hi>Domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt tells <hi>John,</hi> that though he had been abſent, and ſeemingly ſilent for about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years, that yet he was not ſo taken up with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, contents, and glory of Heaven, as that he did not care what became of his Church on earth, O no! and therefore he opens his choiceſt ſecrets, and makes known the moſt hidden and gloriou myſteries to <hi>John,</hi> that ever was made known to any man; as there was none that had ſo much of the heart of Chriſt as <hi>John,</hi> ſo there was none had ſo much of the ear of Chriſt as <hi>John;</hi> Chriſt ſingles out his ſervant <hi>John</hi> from all the men in the world, and makes known to him all the happy providences, and all the ſad occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were to come upon the followers of the Lamb, that ſo they might know what to fit for, and what to pray for, and what to wait for; Alſo he declares to <hi>John</hi>

Thus you ſee, that they which keep up the power of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs in their hearts and lives, they ſhall be ſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the choiceſt preſence of God, and the cleareſt, fulleſt and ſweeteſt diſcoveries of God, and of theſe great things that concern the internal and eternal good of their ſouls. Nothing wins upon God like holyneſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing delights God like holyneſs, nothing engages the preſence of God like holyneſs.

But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you, in your greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and moſt deadly dangers, then keep cloſe to inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſhip, keep cloſe to Goſpel ordinances, keep cloſe to your Church ſtate, <hi>Exod. 20. 24.

For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> The promiſe of Gods gracious aſſiſtance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and acceptance is annexed to his Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be great or ſmall, numerous or few. <hi>Mat. 28. 20, Lo, I am with you alway,</hi> according to my Godhead,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104355:100"/> Majeſty, grace and ſpirit; Lo, I am with you to own <note place="margin">Chriſt in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances doth as Mary open a box of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which diffuſeth a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſavour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints and this makes the ordinances precious in their eyes.</note> you; Lo, I am with you to counſel and direct you; Lo, I am with you to cheer and comfort you; Lo, I am with you to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen you; Lo, I am with you to ſhelter you, and protect you; Lo, I am with you to do all your works in you, and for you; Lo, I am with you to ſtrengthen your graces, and to weaken your ſins; Lo, I am with you to ſcatter your fears, and anſwer your doubts; Lo, I am wirh you to better your hearts, and to mend your lives; Lo, I am with you to bleſs you and crown you with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and glory. And what can the ſoul deſire more? Such as have low thoughts of Goſpel-ordinances, ſuch as ſlight Goſpel-ordinances, ſuch as neglect Goſpel-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, ſuch as vilify Goſpel-ordinances, ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry Goſpel-ordinances, ſuch as oppoſe Goſpel-ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſuch may talk of the preſence of Chriſt, and ſuch may boaſt of the preſence of Chriſt, but all ſuch are out of the way of enjoying the preſence of Chriſt; Chriſt is only to be met with in his own worſhip and in his own ways. Ah how many in theſe dayes are there that are like to old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> that had loſt his taſt and hearing, and <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 35.</note> ſo cared not for <hi>David</hi>'s feaſts and muſick! How many are there that formerly were very zealous for ordinances, but now are as zealous againſt them! How many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have made many great, hard &amp; dangerous ventures to enjoy Goſpel ordinances, who now won't venture a broken ſhin for an ordinance, no nor ſtir out of doors to enjoy an ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How many in our dayes upon neglecting and deſpiſing Goſpel-ordinances, have grown from naught to be very naught, and from very naught to be ſtark naught! He ſhall be an <hi>Apollo</hi> to me, that can ſhew me one man in the world, that ever grew better or holyer by neglecting or ſlighting Goſpel-ordinances. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to the ordinances too like the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Dog, which laps a little as he runs by the ſide of <hi>Nylus,</hi> but ſtays not to drink. How many in this great City run eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath to hear this man and that, and here they lap
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104355:100"/> a little and there a little, but never ſtay to drink, never fix in this Congregation or that, this way or that. Theſe perſons are neither wiſe, ſerious, lovely nor lively in the ways of God. I think they are judicially blinded and hardned, that are indifferent whether they enjoy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or not, or that can part with ordinances, with <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 18.</note> dry eyes. Surely the Child is either very ſullen, or very ſick that cryes not for the breaſt. As ever you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the gracious preſence of God with you in all your troubles and diſtreſſes, make conſcience of ſticking cloſe to Goſpel-ordinances. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you would enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you in your greateſt troubles, deepeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes and moſt deadly dangers, then when you are not in troubles, diſtreſſes, dangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ſure you make much conſcience of five things, 1. Of prizing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence above all other things, ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> did; ſo <hi>Auguſtin</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ex. 33. 13. to 17.</note> would willingly go through Hell to Chriſt, and <hi>Luther</hi> had rather be in Hell with Chriſt, than in Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; and <hi>Bernard</hi> had rather have Chriſt in a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corner, than be in Heaven without him. 2. Of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this gracious preſence againſt ſin, the world, the fleſh, oppoſitions and temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Of walking ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to this gracious preſence. 4. Of lamenting and mourning over thoſe that want this gracious preſence. 5. Of holding any ſecret intelligence or correſpondence with the profeſt and known enemies of Chriſt; Princes will never vouchſafe their favourable preſence to ſuch ſubjects as hold any ſecret intelligence with their profeſt &amp; known enemies, either at home or abroad, ſo here. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you in your greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, then in all your troubles and diſtreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maintain uprightneſs and integrity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">Pſal. 5. 12.</note> with God, 2 <hi>Chron. 16. 9 For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi> Pſalm 84. 11. <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun and ſhield, the</hi>

The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtands in need of two things, Proviſion and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for the firſt, the Lord is a Sun, as full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the Sun is of light; He is a Sun, in that he doth enlighten and enliven his Church, when as all the world beſides lye under darkneſs and the ſhadow of death; and in that he doth chear, and warm, and comfort the hearts of his People by his preſence and lightſome countenance, and is the fountain from whence all external, internal, and eternal bleſſings are derived to them; For the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a Shield: Among all inanimate Creatures the Sun <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 2.</note> is the moſt excellent, and among all artificial Creatures a Shield is chiefeſt, and was of greateſt uſe in thoſe dayes; The <hi>Sun</hi> notes all manner of excellency and proſperity, and the <hi>Shield</hi> notes all manner of protection whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <note place="margin">Iſa 60. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now this choice, this ſweet, this full; this large promiſe is made over only to the upright, &amp; therefore as you would have any ſhare in it, maintain your uprightneſs, <hi>Pſalm 11. 7. His countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> Heb. <hi>His faces.</hi> Every gracious diſcovery of God to the upright, is his face; God will all manner of wayes make gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his love and delight to upright ones; No Father can ſo much delight to behold the countenance of his child, as God delights to behold the countenance of the upright, <hi>Pſalm 112. 4. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth light in darkneſs;</hi> Light commonly ſignifies joy, <note place="margin">Job 30. 26. Eſth. 8. 16. 2 Cor. 6. 10.</note> comfort, peace, help, deliverance. The upright man ſhall have joy in tribulation, plenty in penury; liberty in bonds, life in death, as the Martyrs have frequently and gloriouſly experienced. Sometimes God turnes the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104355:101"/> upright mans adverſity into proſperity, his ſickneſs into health, his weakneſs into ſtrength, his night into day, his ſtormes into calmes, his long Winter-nights into pleaſant Summer-days. Sometimes God hides his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ones in the hollow of his hand, in his pavilion, in his preſence-chamber; when his judgments are abroad <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 9, 20. Mal. 3. 17.</note> in the earth, he takes ſpecial care of his Jewels, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when the upright are in darkneſs and in great <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 19. Pſal. 71. 20, 21.</note> diſtreſs, God chears their hearts with the conſolations of his Spirit, and the light of his countenance. By all which it is moſt evident, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs.</hi> O Sirs, do but maintain your upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all your troubles and diſtreſſes, and then you will be ſure of the gracious preſence of God with you in all your troubles and diſtreſſes. God values an upright <hi>Job</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 8. Cap. 2. 3, 7, 8, 9. Luke 16.</note> upon a Dunghil, before a deceitful <hi>Jehu</hi> upon his Royal Throne; he ſets a higher price upon an upright <hi>Lazarus</hi> in rags, than upon a rich <hi>Dives</hi> in his purple robes; And therefore when an upright man is in troubles and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God will be ſure to keep him company. The upright mans Motto is <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> he is like the Philoſophers Dye, caſt him which way you will, and into what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you will, he is ſtill upright, and therefore of all perſons God loves to grace the upright man with his gracious preſence. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would enjoy the gracious preſence of God with you, in all your troubles, deep diſtreſſes and moſt deadly dangers, then you muſt be very earneſt and importunate with God not to leave you, but to ſtay with you, to abide with you, and to dwell in the midſt of you, <hi>Pſalm 148. 18.

See <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 10, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 23, 24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21—ult. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9, 10. Is your condition low, then let your hearts be low; he that is little in his own account, is great in Gods eſteem, and ſhall be ſure to enjoy moſt of his preſence.

Many may talk much of God, and many may profeſs much of God, and many may boaſt much of God; but he only enjoys much of God, who makes conſcience of walking humbly with God. But</p>
            <p>Eightly and laſtly, If you would enjoy the ſignal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with you, in your greateſt troubles, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">Ponder upon theſe Scriptures, Iſa. 58. 8. 9, 10, 11 2 Cor. 6. 16, 17, 18. Cap. 7. 1. Deut. 23. 13, 14.</note> diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, then labour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more and more after greater meaſures of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the more holineſs you reach to, the more you ſhall have of the preſence of a holy God with you, in all your ſtraits and trials. If the Scriptures be narrowly ſearched, you will find that men of the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and degrees of holineſs, have alwayes enjoyed the greateſt meaſures of the Divine preſence; witneſs <hi>Enoch, Geneſ. 5. 24. Noah, Geneſ. 6. 8, 9, 17, 18.</hi> So <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob, Joſeph, Job, David, Daniel, John, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. they were all famous for holineſs, and accordingly they had a famous preſence of God with them, as hath been ſhewed in part, and might more fully have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but that the preſs calls upon me to haſten to a concluſion; and therefore I ſhall now but hint at things, conſider.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the more holy any perſon is, the more excellent that perſon is, all corruptions are diminutions
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104355:104"/> of excellency; the more mixt any thing is, the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed it is; the more you mix your wine with water, the more you abaſe your wine; and the more you mix your gold with tin, the more you abaſe your gold: But the purer your wine is, the richer and better your wine is; and the purer your gold is, the more glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent it is; ſo the purer and holier any perſon is, the more excellent and glorious that perſon is. Now the more Divinely excellent, and glorious any perſon is, the <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 23.</note> more he is beloved of God; and the more he is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of God, and the more he ſhall have of the preſence of God. Conſider</p>
            <p>Secondly, The more holy any perſon is, the more that perſon pleaſes the Lord: Fruitfulneſs in holineſs fills Heaven with joy; the Husbandman is not ſo much pleaſed with the fruitfulneſs of his fields, nor the Wife with the fruitfulneſs of her womb, as God is pleaſed with the fruitfulneſs of his People in grace and holineſs. Now certainly the more God is pleaſed with any perſon, the more he will be preſent with that perſon; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly have moſt of our preſence, that moſt pleaſe us. <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 5.

               </gap> imports. <hi>Enoch</hi> eyed God at all times, in all places, and in all companies, and this pleaſed God: Where ever <hi>Enoch</hi> was, his eye was ſtill upon God. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> walked conſtantly with God, his whole life was but one continued day of walking with God, and this pleaſed God. <hi>Enoch</hi> kept himſelf from the corruptions and pollutions of the times, which were very great; he was not carried away with the ſtream of the times, he kept a conſtant counter-motion to the corrupt courſes of the times, and this pleaſed God. <hi>Enoch</hi> maintained and kept up a clear, choice, and ſtanding communion with God, and this pleaſed God. <hi>Enoch</hi> made it his buſineſs, his work, his Heaven to approve his heart to God, and his wayes to God, and this pleaſed God. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> was very ſerious, and ſtudious to avoid every thing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104355:104"/> that might be a diſhonour to God, or diſpleaſing to God, and this pleaſed God. <hi>Enoch</hi> had great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, and this pleaſed God.

It was a ſingular mercy for God to be with <hi>Enoch</hi> on Earth, but it was a far more glorious mercy for <hi>Enoch</hi> to be with God in Heaven. The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence of God is very deſirable, but the glorious preſence of God is moſt comfortable. <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſes God, and God tranſlates <hi>Enoch:</hi> We can never have thoſe Friends near enough to us, who take a pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to pleaſe us; So here, <hi>Enoch</hi> was a bright morning Star, a riſing Sun for vertue and holineſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God could not ſatisfie himſelf (to ſpeak after the manner of men) that he ſhould live at ſo great a diſtance from him, and therefore tranſlates him from Earth to Heaven.

That he followed Chriſt cloſeſt to the high Prieſts Palace. 3. That he ſtood cloſe to Chriſt when he was on the Croſs, though others had baſely deſerted him, and turned their backs upon him. 4. That Chriſt commended the care of his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104355:105"/> Virgin Mother to him. Now, why did Chriſts deſire, love, and delight run out with a ſtronger and a fuller tide towards <hi>John,</hi> than to the reſt of the Diſciples? doubtleſs it was becauſe <hi>John</hi> did more reſemble Chriſt than the reſt, it was becauſe <hi>John</hi> was a more exact pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and lively repreſentation than the others were. Now the more any man in holineſs is like to Chriſt, the more any man in holineſs reſembles Chriſt; the more that man ſhall enjoy of the preſence of Chriſt, the more that man ſhall lay in the boſom of Chriſt. The Father loves to be moſt with that Child that is like him moſt: So here, As ever you would enjoy the preſence of God in your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, be ſure that you keep up holineſs in your hearts and lives, be ſure that you grow in holineſs, and flouriſh in holineſs, and then you ſhall be ſure of the preſence of God with you, in all your troubles, and deep diſtreſſes: A holy God will never leave the holy Chriſtian; and thus much for this uſe of Exhortation.</p>

How can you want Peace, who have alwayes the preſence of the Prince of Peace with you? But.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:104355:107"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Know for your comfort, that if God be with you, there is nothing, there can be nothing but weakneſs againſt you. <hi>Iſa. 27. 4. Who would ſet the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi> 
               <note place="margin">God holdeth the Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in chains, having his hook in their noſe, and his bridle in their lips, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 29. he can eaſily rule and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule his proudeſt Enemies.</note> 
               <hi>and thorns againſt me in battel, I would go through them, I would burn them together?</hi> What are briars and thorns to a devouring fire, to the conſuming flames? no more are all the Enemies of the Church to the preſence of God with his People: God will be a burning and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire to all the Enemies of <hi>Zion;</hi> wicked men are chaff: <hi>Pſalm 1. 1. And what is that to the wind, to the whirl wind? they are ſtubble.</hi> Job 21. 18. <hi>They are as driven ſtubble to his bow.</hi> Iſai. 41. 2. <hi>They are as ſtubble fully dry.</hi> Nahum. 1. 10. <hi>They are as ſtubble before the flame.</hi> Joel 2. 5. <hi>They arelike duſt.</hi> 2 Kings 13. 7. <hi>Yea like ſmall duſt.</hi> Iſa. 29. 5. <hi>They are like a morning cloud, an early dew, a little ſmoak.</hi> Hoſea 13. 3. <hi>The morning cloud is ſoon diſpelled, the early dew is ſoon dried up, the rowling ſmoak out of the chimney is preſently ſcattered.</hi> O the weakneſs of man! O the power of God! No Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on Earth have ſuch a power on their ſides as the Saints have, conſult theſe Scriptures, 2 <hi>Kings 6. 16. 2 Chron. 32. 6, 7. Iſai. 8. 9, 10. Numb 13. 28, 30, 31, 32, 33. Cap.</hi> 14. 9. No Chriſtian can look upon the ſtrong and mighty Enemies of <hi>Zion</hi> in a Scripture glaſs, but muſt behold them as weak and impotent Perſons: Who could but ſmile to ſee weak Children to attempt to <note place="margin">Zach. 2. 5.</note> beſiege a wall of braſs, or a wall of fire? as great a folly and weakneſs it is for wicked men to make attempts, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints, who have been to this day, and will be to the end, a trembling and a burdenſome ſtone to all <note place="margin">Cap. 12. 2, 3.</note> that gather together againſt them. Senſe looks upon the Powers of the world as ſtrong, mighty, and invincible; but Faith looks upon them as poor, weak, contemptible, gaſping, dying Men. Thus heroical <hi>Luther</hi> look'd upon them: <hi>Contemptus eſt a me Romanus &amp; favor &amp; furor, I care neither for Romes favour nor fury;</hi> I am neither fond of the one, nor afraid of the other. It is dangerous to look upon the Powers of the world in the Devils multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104355:107"/> glaſs; it is beſt and ſafeſt to look upon them in a Scripture glaſs, and then we ſhall never fear them, nor ſinfully ſhift them. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If God be ſignally preſent with his People, in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, then know for your comfort, that none can be againſt you but they muſt be againſt God himſelf; for God is with you in all your troubles, as a <note place="margin">Acts 9. 4, 5, 6.</note> Father is with his Child, a Husband with his Wife, a General with his Army, and as a Confederate with his Allies, who is with them offenſively and defenſively; hence they are ſaid to rage againſt God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 28, 29. And to blaſpheme God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 3, 6. And to fight <note place="margin">See Acts 23. 9. Prov. 21. 30.</note> againſt God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5 38, 39. To fight againſt God, is labour in vain; who ever ſought againſt God, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? Some think that this Phraſe of fighting againſt God, is drawn from the Fable of the Gyants, which were ſaid to make war with the Gods. The Church of Chriſt alwayes flouriſheth moſt, and increaſeth moſt, when the <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 12, 1.</note> Tyrants of the Earth oppoſe it moſt, and perſecute it moſt. <hi>Diocletian</hi> laid down the Empire in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, becauſe he could not by any perſecution ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the true Chriſtian Religion; the more violent he was againſt the People of God, the more they increaſed and multiplied, and the more they were emboldned and encouraged; and therefore in a rage he throws up all. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If the ſignal preſence of God be with his People, in their greateſt troubles, deepeſt diſtreſſes, and moſt deadly dangers, then know for your comfort, that there is no preſence like this preſence, no preſence to the preſence of God; let me evidence this by an induction of ſix particulars bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fly thus: For Firſt, It is the preſence of an Almighty God. <hi>Geneſ. 17. 1. I am the Almighty</hi>

               <hi>God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Some derive the word <hi>Shaddai,</hi> here uſed from <hi>dai,</hi> that ſignifieth <hi>ſufficiency.</hi> God is an all ſufficient good, and a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient good, he is an Independent good, an abſolute
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104355:108"/> good, an original good, an univerſal good; ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the word <hi>Shaddai</hi> from <hi>Shad,</hi> that ſignifieth <hi>a breaſt, a dug,</hi> becauſe God feedeth his Children with ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all good things, as the loving Mother doth the Child with the milk of her breaſts. God is the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory good, and proportionable good, and ſutable good to our ſouls; as the breaſt, the dug is the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table good to the Childs ſtomach: And others derive the word <hi>Shaddai</hi> from <hi>Shaddad,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>to ſpoil, conquer, or overcome,</hi> and ſo they ſay; that God did here invert or overcome the order of nature, in cauſing the barren to bear: But moſt Authors do tranſlate it Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent; God then is called <hi>Shaddai,</hi> that is omnipotent and all-ſufficient, for his omnipotency includeth alſo all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency. Secondly, you have the preſence of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God with you. <hi>Iſa. 43. 4. Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee.</hi> But that this may the better ſtick and work, you muſt remember, Firſt, that God loves you with a firſt <note place="margin">See De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. 7. 7, 8.</note> love. 1 <hi>John 4. 19. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Our love is but a reflex of his. God firſt caſt an eye of love upon us, before we caſt an eye of love on him, and therefore God is no way indebted to us for our love. <hi>Mary</hi> anſwers not <hi>Rabboni,</hi> till Chriſt firſt ſaid unto her <note place="margin">John 20. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Mary.</hi> The pure nature of love is more ſeen in Gods firſt love to us, than in ours to him; by nature we were <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 12. 19. Rom. 5. 10. Cap. 1. 30.</note> without God, and afar of from God, we were ſtrangers to God, and enemies to God, yea haters of God; and therefore if God had not loved us firſtly, we had been undone everlaſtingly. Secondly, As God loves you with a firſt love, ſo he loves you with a free love. <hi>Hoſea 14. 4. I will heal their back-ſliding, I will love them freely:</hi> I know they are back-ſliden, but I will heal their back-ſlidings; I know they have broken their bones by their fall, but I will make thoſe broken bones to rejoyce; I know there is nothing at all in them that is excellent or eminent, that is honourable or acceptable, that is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable or lovely, yet <hi>I will love them freely, Ex mero motu,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:104355:108"/> of mine own, free, rich, abſolute, ſoveraign, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent grace. Thirdly, As he loves you with a free love, ſo he loves you with an everlaſting love. <hi>Jer. 31. 3. I have loved thee with an everlaſting love: therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> Heb. <hi>I love thee with the love of perpetuity,</hi> or with the love of Eternity. My love and my affections continue ſtill the ſame to thee, and ſhall do for ever; or as others carry the words, I love thee with an Ancient love, or with the love of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty; I love thee ſtill with the ſame affection, that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages I bare towards thee. Fourthly, As he loves you with an everlaſting love, ſo he loves you with an unchangeable love. <hi>Mal. 3. 6. I am the Lord I change not: therefore ye ſons of Jacob are not conſumed</hi> Men change, and counſels change, and occurrences change, and Friends change, and Relations change, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms change, and Common-wealths change; but God never changes, as <hi>Balaam</hi> confeſſes, who was the Devils <note place="margin">Numb. 3. 19.</note> Hackney, and who had a mind to dance with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil all day, and then ſup with Chriſt at night. God is neither falſe nor fickle, he cannot like men ſay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, <note place="margin">Pſalm 89. 34.</note> he can nor alter his mind nor eat his words. <hi>[The Eternity of Iſrael cannot lie nor repent, for he is not a man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 29.</note> 
               <hi>that he ſhould repent.]</hi> Men are ſo mutable and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that there is no hold to be taken of what they ſay; but God is immutable in his nature, in his eſſence, in his counſels, in his attributes, in his decrees, in his promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is (as the School-men ſay) <hi>Omninò immutabi lis, Altogether immutable.</hi> Fifthly, As he loves you with an unchangeable love, ſo he loves you with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <note place="margin">P ſalm 146. 7, 8</note> love, with a peculiar love, with a diſtinguiſhing love, with a ſuperlative love. The Lord executes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the oppreſſed, he gives food to the hungry, he looſeth the Priſoners, he opens the eyes of the blind, he raiſes them that are bowed down, he loveth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and this is more than all the reſt. Sixthly, and laſtly, As he loves his People with a ſpecial love, with a peculiar love, ſo he loves them with the greateſt love
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104355:109"/> with a matchleſs love. <hi>[O Daniel greatly beloved.]</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a <hi>ſic</hi> without a <hi>ſicut;</hi> there being nothing in nature wherewith to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel it: This <hi>ſic</hi> without a <hi>ſicut,</hi> ſignifies the greatneſs of Gods love, the vehemency of his love, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirableneſs of his love. Now what an unſpeakable comfort muſt this be to his Saints, to have the preſence of a loving God, to have the preſence of ſuch a loving God with them, in all their troubles and deep diſtreſſes? If the preſence of a loving Friend, a loving Relation in our troubles and diſtreſſes be ſuch a mercy, O! what then is the preſence of a loving God. Thirdly, It is the <note place="margin">Pſalm 18. 2. 2 Chron. 16. 9. Prov. 18. 10. Jer 32. 40. 41. Iſa. 30. 18, 19. Iſa. 27. 3. Jer. 31. 23.</note> preſence of an active God, who will be a defence to you, a Shield to you, a Sword to you, a Buckler to you, a Sun to you, a ſtrong Tower to you, a Salvation to you; none can withſtand him, none can equal him, none can out act him. Fourthly, It is the preſence of a wakeful God, of a watchful God, of a God that never, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſlumbers or ſleeps; God will be ſo far from ſleeping that he will not ſo much as ſlumber. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 121. 3, 4, 5. The Phraſe is taken from watchmen, who ſtand on the walls in time of war, to diſcover the approaches of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and accordingly give warning; Now watchmen have been treacherous and ſleepy. The Capitol of <hi>Rome</hi> had been taken by the Gaules, if the Geeſe had not been more wakeful then the watchmen of the walls. <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the Athenian Captain viſiting the Guards on the walls of <hi>Corinth;</hi> found one of the watch aſleep, and preſently thruſt him thorough with his ſword, ſaying: Dead I found him, and dead I left him; though watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſlumber and ſleep, yet that God that is preſent with his People doth neither, his ſeven eyes are alwayes open. Fifthly, It is the preſence of a wiſe God, of an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient <note place="margin">Ezech. 3. 9. Pſalm. 33. 10, 11. Iſa. 46. 10. Cap. 40. 28. Rom. 11. 33. 2 Pet. 2. 9. Jonh 1. 5. 1 Kings 14. 6 Matth. 26. 24, 25</note> God; God fills all things, he encompaſſeth all things, and he ſuſtaineth all things, and therefore he muſt needs know all things. God can find <hi>Jonah</hi> in the bottom of the ſhip; and <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Wife in her diſguiſes; and <hi>Judas</hi> inhis Treaſon, and <hi>Demas</hi> in his Apoſtacy:

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>opened as the entrails of a Sacrifice,</hi> cut down the back. The Apoſtle, ſay ſome, uſeth a Metaphor taken from a ſheep, whoſe skin is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and he hanged up by the neck, with his back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wall, and all his entrailes laid bare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to open view. He alludes, ſay others, to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomizing of a Creature, wherein men are very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to find out every little vein or muſcle, though they be never ſo cloſe. They are naked, therefore God ſees their outſide, and opened, diſſected, quartered, and cleft aſunder through the back bone, ſo that he ſees their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide alſo. Opened is more than naked; naked is that which is not cloathed or covered; opened is that whoſe inwards are diſcovered, and made conſpicuous. Some make it a Metaphor, from thoſe that lie with their faces upwards, that all Paſſengers may ſee who they are. Is it of ſuch a comfort to have the preſence of a wiſe, and knowing friend with us, in our greateſt troubles, and deepeſt diſtreſſes; what a tranſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndent comfort muſt it be, to enjoy the preſence of an all-ſeeing, and an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing God, in all our troubles and diſtreſſes. The eye of Heaven ſees all, and knows all, and writes down all thy troubles and trials, thy ſorrows and ſufferings, <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 32.</note> thy loſſes and croſſes; and accordingly will an all-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God act for his own glory and his Peoples good. Sixthly and laſtly, It is the preſence of a God of Mercy, a God of Bowels, a God of compaſſions. <hi>Jer. 31. 18, 19, <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 7. 8.</note> 20. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 8, 9. Lament.</hi> 3. 22. His compaſſions fail not. Mercy is as eſſential to God as light is to the Sun, or as heat is to the fire: He delights in mercy, as the ſenſes and faculties of the ſoul do in their <note place="margin">Micha 7. 18, 19.</note>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:104355:110"/> ſeveral actions: Patience and clemency, and mercy, and compaſſion, and peace are the fruits of his bowels, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring which the Divine Nature doth produce; Gods compaſſions are Fatherly compaſſions, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103. 13. They are Motherly compaſſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 15. They are Brotherly compaſſions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. They are Friendly compaſſions, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1, 2. O how ſweet muſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a God of mercy, a God of compaſſion be to the Saints in a day of trouble? the preſence of a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Friend in a day of diſtreſs, is very deſirable and comfortable; what then is the preſence of a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate God? Thus you ſee that there is no preſence to the Divine preſence, no preſence to the ſignal preſence of God with his People, in their greateſt troubles and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtreſſes. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, If God be ſignally preſent with his People, in their greateſt troubles and deepeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, then let them all know for their comfort, that this preſence will make up the want or loſs of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 8.</note> comforts, this preſence will make up the loſs of a Husband, a Child, a Friend, an Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Look as all light meets in the Sun, and as all water meets in the Sea, ſo all our outward comforts meet in the God of all <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> comfort. When <hi>Alexander</hi> asked King <hi>Porus,</hi> being then his Priſoner, how he would be uſed? He anſwered in one word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e. like a King: Alexander</hi> again replying, Do you deſire nothing elſe? No, ſaith <hi>Porus,</hi> all things are in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in this one word, <hi>like a King;</hi> ſo all things, all comforts are to be found in this ſignal preſence of God with his People, in their greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and deepeſt diſtreſſes; certainly the gracious preſence of the Lord is infinitely better than the preſence of all outward comforts, as you know one Sun is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and comfortable than ten thouſand Stars.</p>
            <p>But how may a perſon that has loſt this gracious <label type="milestone">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104355:110"/> by ſinful omiſſions, then be more active in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Didſt thou loſe the preſence of God by neglecting thy watch, or by not walking with God, or by an eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the world, or by cloſing with this or that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by letting fall thy communion with God; take a contrary courſe, now keep up thy watch, walk cloſe with God, keep up a daily converſe with lively Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 63.

After Chriſt had ſtood knocking and calling to his Spouſe <hi>[Open to me my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, my Love, my Dove, my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled, for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night,</hi> Cant. 5. 2, 3, 6.] but found no entrance, he retired and withdrew himſelf, becauſe ſhe would not ariſe, and put on her coat; but when ſhe beſtirs her ſelf, <hi>ſhe finds him whom her ſoul loved,</hi> Cant 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. Then Chriſt comes into his garden again, and returns to his Spouſe again, and forgets all former unkindneſs, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. 1, 2. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Enquire where, when, and why God has withdrawn himſelf, as we do when dear Friends abſent themſelves from us, <hi>O the hope of Iſrael, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why ſhouldeſt thou be as a ſtranger in the Land, and as a way-faring man that turneth aſide to tarry for a night?</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou be as a man aſtonied, as a mighty man that cannot ſave? Yet thou, O Lord, art in the midſt of us, and we are called by thy Name, leave us not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Stand not with Chriſt for any thing, not for a right eye, or a right hand, nor for an <hi>Iſaac</hi> or a <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> don't ſay this work is too high, and that too hard, and t'other too hot, and the other too dangerous, in order to the recovery of Gods countenance and preſence, thou muſt not think any thing in the world too much to do for Chriſt, or to ſuffer for Chriſt; thou wilt be a happy man if thou canſt recover Chriſts loſt preſence, though it be upon the hardeſt termes imaginable. But,</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:104355:111"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Let your hearts lye humble and low under <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Pet. 5. 6.</note> the loſs of Gods gracious preſence: For, 1.

'Tis a loſs that will coſt a man dear before it will be made up again. O the ſighs, the groans, the ſtrong crycs, the earneſt prayers, the bottles of tears, that the recovery of the Divine preſence will coſt a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, upon all which accounts, how well does it become a Chriſtian to lye humble at the foot of God!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Lift up a mighty cry to Heaven: Thus the Saints of old have done: conſult theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. to 13. <hi>Lam. 3. 56, 57. Pſal. 4. 6, 7. Pſal. 27. 9. Pſal. 38. 21, 22. Pſal. 138. 3. Pſal. 119. 8. O forſake me</hi>

                  </gap>ears; But you are not bound to make this an Article of your Faith.</note> 
               <hi>not utterly;</hi> Chriſt was forſaken for a few houres, <hi>David</hi> for a few months, and <hi>Job</hi> for a few years, for the tryal and exerciſe of his faith and patience; but then they all ſent up a mighty cry to Heaven: Leave them, God did to their thinking, but forſake them he did in regard of viſion, but not in regard of union. The promiſe is, that <hi>God will draw near to us if we draw near to him,</hi> Jam. 4. 8. Draw nigh to God in duty, and he will draw nigh to you in mercy; Sanctify him, and he will ſatisfie you. Prayer is the only means to ſupply all defects, it gets all, and makes up the loſs of all, as a gracious poor women ſaid in her diſtreſs, I have no Friend, but I have prayer,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104355:111"/> that will get favour with my God, ſo long as I can find a praying heart, God will (I am ſure of that) find a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying heart, and a helping hand. It is not the length, but the ſtrength of prayer; it is not the labour of the lip, <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 12, 13, 14.</note> but the travel of the heart that prevails with God; it is not the Arithmetick of our prayers, how many they are, nor the Rhetorick of our prayers, how eloquent they be; nor the Geometry of our prayers, how long they be; nor the Muſick of our prayers, how ſweet they be; nor the Logick of our prayers, how methodical they be, that will carry the day with God, it is only fervency, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in prayer, that will make a man prevalent with God. Fervent prayer hits the mark, carries the day, and pierceth the walls of Heaven, though like thoſe of <hi>Gaza</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 16, 17. Luk. 18. Iſa. 45. 2.</note> made of Braſs and Iron. The Child has got many a kiſs, and many a hug by crying; if God has withdrawn his preſence, the beſt, the ſureſt, and the readieſt way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, is to ſend up a mighty cry to Heaven. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Be ſure you don't take up your reſt in any <note place="margin">Jer. 50. 6.</note> Creature, in any comfort, in any contentment, in any worldly enjoyment. When the preſence of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from you, ſay as <hi>Abſalom, What is all this to me,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 14. 24, 28, 32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>ſo long as I am baniſhed my Fathers preſence, ſo long as I can't ſee the Kings face.</hi> When the Mother ſees that the Child is taken with the baby, the rattle, the fiddle, ſhe comes not in ſight: If you take up your reſt in any of the babies, in any of the poor things of this world, God will certainly keep out of ſight, he will never honour them with his countenance and preſence, who take up in any thing below himſelf, below his favour, below his preſence. I have read of a devout Pelgrim, who going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was very kindly and nobly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in ſeveral places but ſtill he cryed out, O but this is not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this is not <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> So when you caſt your eye upon thiis Creature, or that, O then cry out, This is not the preſence of God, this is not the preſence of God; &amp; when you begin to be tickled &amp;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104355:112"/> taken with this and that enjoyment, with this or that contentment, O then remember, this is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, this is not the preſence of God! Here is a gracious yoke-fellow, here are hopeful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, here is a pleaſant habitation, here is brave air, here is a gainful trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what are all theſe to me, ſo long as my Sun is ſet in a cloud, and God has withdrawn his preſence from me?

Conſult the Scriptures in the margin: Here God dwells, here he walks, here he makes known his glory, here he gives forth his love, here he vouchſafes his preſence; when God is withdrawn your great buſineſs is to prize Ordinances, and to keep cloſe to ordinances, till God ſhall be pleaſed to lift up the light of his countenance, and vouchſafe his preſence to you; you will never recover the Divine preſence by neglecting ordinances, nor by ſlighting ordinances, nor by turning your back upon ordinances, nor by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low thoughts of ordinances. He that thinks ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be needleſs things concludes, 1. That the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Kingdom of Heaven from the Jews was no <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 43. Joh. 5. 2. to 10.</note> great judgment. 2. That the beſtowing of it upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People is no great mercy. If God be gone, 'tis good to lay at the pool till he returns: There are many dear Chriſtians who have loſt their God for a time, but after a time they have found him again in the way of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and therefore let no temptation draw thee off from ordinances, ſay, here I will live, here I will lie, here I will wait at the pool of ordinances, till the Lord ſhall return in mercy to my ſoul.</p>
            <p>I ſhall follow this Diſcourſe of the Divine preſence with my earneſt prayers, that it may from on high be
